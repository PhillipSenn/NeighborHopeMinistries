We can't use //cdn.PhillipSenn.com any more because Neighbor Hope Ministries uses https.
THEREFORE, what I have to do is map /fw/ to a common area.
And I don't think that making changes to /fw/ should be taken lightly, so it's ok if getting there
on production is a little bit hard.

c:\home\fw

They way that you get there is to change NeighborHopeMinistries.com/fw and then remote to the vps and copy
the changes up to c:\home\fw

So NeighborHopeMinistries.com is your testing server.
And dev.NeighborHopeMinistries.com is your dev server.
