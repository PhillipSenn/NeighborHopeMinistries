<font size="-1">1</font> The record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez was the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz was the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> Jesse was the father of David the king.
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> David was the father of Solomon by Bathsheba who had been the wife of Uriah.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Josiah became the father of Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> After the deportation to Babylon: Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Zerubbabel was the father of Abihud, Abihud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Eliud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called the Messiah.
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen generations.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="402s"></a>Conception and Birth of Jesus</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her, planned to send her away secretly.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> "She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins."
<br><font size="-1">22</font> Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet:

<br><font size="-1">24</font> And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took <i>Mary</i> as his wife,
<br><font size="-1">25</font> but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son; and he called His name Jesus.

<font size="-1">1</font> Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him."
<br><font size="-1">3</font> When Herod the king heard <i>this,</i> he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea; for this is what has been written by the prophet:
<br><font size="-1">6</font> ''A<font size="-1">ND YOU</font>, B<font size="-1">ETHLEHEM</font>, <font size="-1">LAND OF</font> J<font size="-1">UDAH</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">RE BY NO MEANS LEAST AMONG THE LEADERS OF</font> J<font size="-1">UDAH</font>; <br>F<font size="-1">OR OUT OF YOU SHALL COME FORTH A</font> R<font size="-1">ULER</font> <br>W<font size="-1">HO WILL</font> <font size="-1">SHEPHERD</font> M<font size="-1">Y PEOPLE</font> I<font size="-1">SRAEL</font>.''&nbsp;"
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> Then Herod secretly called the magi and determined from them the exact time the star appeared.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the Child; and when you have found <i>Him,</i> report to me, so that I too may come and worship Him."
<br><font size="-1">9</font> After hearing the king, they went their way; and the star, which they had seen in the east, went on before them until it came and stood over <i>the place</i> where the Child was.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> After coming into the house they saw the Child with Mary His mother; and they fell to the ground and worshiped Him. Then, opening their treasures, they presented to Him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> And having been warned <i>by God</i> in a dream not to return to Herod, the magi left for their own country by another way.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="404s"></a>The Flight to Egypt</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> Now when they had gone, behold, an angel of the Lord *appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up! Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search for the Child to destroy Him."
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> So Joseph got up and took the Child and His mother while it was still night, and left for Egypt.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> He remained there until the death of Herod. <i>This was</i> to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "O<font size="-1">UT OF</font> E<font size="-1">GYPT</font> I <font size="-1">CALLED</font> M<font size="-1">Y</font> S<font size="-1">ON</font>."
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="405s"></a>Herod Slaughters Babies</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the magi, he became very enraged, and sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and all its vicinity, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the magi.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Then what had been spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:
<br><font size="-1">18</font> "A <font size="-1">VOICE WAS HEARD IN</font> R<font size="-1">AMAH</font>, <br>W<font size="-1">EEPING AND GREAT MOURNING</font>, <br>R<font size="-1">ACHEL WEEPING FOR HER CHILDREN</font>; <br>A<font size="-1">ND SHE REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED</font>, <br>B<font size="-1">ECAUSE THEY WERE NO MORE</font>."
<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord *appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> "Get up, take the Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel; for those who sought the Child''s life are dead."
<br><font size="-1">21</font> So Joseph got up, took the Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Then after being warned <i>by God</i> in a dream, he left for the regions of Galilee,
<br><font size="-1">23</font> and came and lived in a city called Nazareth. <i>This was</i> to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets: "He shall be called a Nazarene."

<br><font size="-1">3</font> For this is the one referred to by Isaiah the prophet when he said, <br>"T<font size="-1">HE VOICE OF ONE</font> <font size="-1">CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS</font>, <br>''M<font size="-1">AKE READY THE WAY OF THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD</font>, <br>M<font size="-1">AKE</font> H<font size="-1">IS PATHS STRAIGHT</font>!''&nbsp;"
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Now John himself had a garment of camel''s hair and a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Then Jerusalem was going out to him, and all Judea and all the district around the Jordan;
<br><font size="-1">6</font> and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
<br><font size="-1">8</font> "Therefore bear fruit in keeping with repentance;
<br><font size="-1">9</font> and do not suppose that you can say to yourselves, ''We have Abraham for our father''; for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> "The axe is already laid at the root of the trees; therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> "As for me, I baptize you with water for repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="407s"></a>The Baptism of Jesus</i></b></font></p>

<br><font size="-1">15</font> But Jesus answering said to him, <font color="red">"Permit <i>it</i> at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness."</font> Then he *permitted Him.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> After being baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove <i>and</i> lighting on Him,

<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> Then the devil *took Him into the holy city and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple,

<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> For when Herod had John arrested, he bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For John had been saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Although Herod wanted to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they regarded John as a prophet.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> But when Herod''s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before <i>them</i> and pleased Herod,

<br><font size="-1">19</font> Ordering the people to sit down on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed <i>the food,</i> and breaking the loaves He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples <i>gave them</i> to the crowds,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> and they all ate and were satisfied. They picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve full baskets.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4059s"></a>Jesus Walks on the Water</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> Immediately He made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> After He had sent the crowds away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray; and when it was evening, He was there alone.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> But the boat was already a long distance from the land, battered by the waves; for the wind was contrary.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, "It is a ghost!" And they cried out in fear.

<br><font size="-1">31</font> Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him, and *said to him, <font color="red">"You of little faith, why did you doubt?"</font>
<br><font size="-1">32</font> When they got into the boat, the wind stopped.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> And those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, "You are certainly God''s Son!"

<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, named Caiaphas;

<br><font size="-1">8</font> But the disciples were indignant when they saw <i>this,</i> and said, "Why this waste?

<br><font size="-1">10</font> But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, <font color="red">"Why do you bother the woman? For she has done a good deed to Me.</font>
<br><font size="-1">11</font> <font color="red">"For you always have the poor with you; but you do not always have Me.</font>

<br><font size="-1">16</font> From then on he <i>began</i> looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus.

<br><font size="-1"><b>30</b></font> After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

<br><font size="-1"><b>39</b></font> And He went a little beyond <i>them,</i> and fell on His face and prayed, saying, <font color="red">"My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will."</font>

<br><font size="-1">41</font> <font color="red">"Keep watching and praying that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>42</b></font> He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, <font color="red">"My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done."</font>
<br><font size="-1">43</font> Again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
<br><font size="-1">44</font> And He left them again, and went away and prayed a third time, saying the same thing once more.
<br><font size="-1">45</font> Then He *came to the disciples and *said to them, <font color="red">"Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</font>

<br><font size="-1">48</font> Now he who was betraying Him gave them a sign, saying, "Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him."
<br><font size="-1">49</font> Immediately Judas went to Jesus and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed Him.
<br><font size="-1">50</font> And Jesus said to him, <font color="red">"Friend, <i>do</i> what you have come for."</font> Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>51</b></font> And behold, one of those who were with Jesus reached and drew out his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear.
<br><font size="-1">52</font> Then Jesus *said to him, <font color="red">"Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.</font>
<br><font size="-1">53</font> <font color="red">"Or do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?</font>
<br><font size="-1">54</font> <font color="red">"How then will the Scriptures be fulfilled, <i>which say</i> that it must happen this way?"</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>55</b></font> At that time Jesus said to the crowds, <font color="red">"Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as <i>you would</i> against a robber? Every day I used to sit in the temple teaching and you did not seize Me.</font>
<br><font size="-1">56</font> <font color="red">"But all this has taken place to fulfill the Scriptures of the prophets."</font> Then all the disciples left Him and fled.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="40112s"></a>Jesus before Caiaphas</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>57</b></font> Those who had seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
<br><font size="-1">58</font> But Peter was following Him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and entered in, and sat down with the officers to see the outcome.
<br><font size="-1"><b>59</b></font> Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death.
<br><font size="-1">60</font> They did not find <i>any,</i> even though many false witnesses came forward. But later on two came forward,
<br><font size="-1">61</font> and said, "This man stated, ''I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.''&nbsp;"
<br><font size="-1">62</font> The high priest stood up and said to Him, "Do You not answer? What is it that these men are testifying against You?"
<br><font size="-1">63</font> But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to Him, "I adjure You by the living God, that You tell us whether You are the Christ, the Son of God."
<br><font size="-1">64</font> Jesus *said to him, <font color="red">"You have said it <i>yourself;</i> nevertheless I tell you, hereafter you will see <font size="-1">THE</font> S<font size="-1">ON OF</font> M<font size="-1">AN SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF</font> P<font size="-1">OWER</font>, and <font size="-1">COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN</font>."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>65</b></font> Then the high priest tore his robes and said, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have now heard the blasphemy;
<br><font size="-1">66</font> what do you think?" They answered, "He deserves death!"
<br><font size="-1"><b>67</b></font> Then they spat in His face and beat Him with their fists; and others slapped Him,

<br><font size="-1">70</font> But he denied <i>it</i> before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are talking about."
<br><font size="-1">71</font> When he had gone out to the gateway, another <i>servant-girl</i> saw him and *said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."

<br><font size="-1">73</font> A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Surely you too are <i>one</i> of them; for even the way you talk gives you away."
<br><font size="-1">74</font> Then he began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.

<br><font size="-1">5</font> And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple sanctuary and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, "It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is the price of blood."
<br><font size="-1">7</font> And they conferred together and with the money bought the Potter''s Field as a burial place for strangers.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="40115s"></a>Jesus before Pilate</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?" And Jesus said to him, <font color="red">"<i>It is as</i> you say."</font>
<br><font size="-1">12</font> And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He did not answer.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Then Pilate *said to Him, "Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?"
<br><font size="-1">14</font> And He did not answer him with regard to even a <i>single</i> charge, so the governor was quite amazed.
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> Now at <i>the</i> feast the governor was accustomed to release for the people <i>any</i> one prisoner whom they wanted.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> So when the people gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
<br><font size="-1">18</font> For he knew that because of envy they had handed Him over.
<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him <i>a message,</i> saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous Man; for last night I suffered greatly in a dream because of Him."
<br><font size="-1">20</font> But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to put Jesus to death.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> But the governor said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas."
<br><font size="-1">22</font> Pilate *said to them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all *said, "Crucify Him!"
<br><font size="-1">23</font> And he said, "Why, what evil has He done?" But they kept shouting all the more, saying, "Crucify Him!"
<br><font size="-1"><b>24</b></font> When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this Man''s blood; see <i>to that</i> yourselves."
<br><font size="-1">25</font> And all the people said, "His blood shall be on us and on our children!"
<br><font size="-1">26</font> Then he released Barabbas for them; but after having Jesus scourged, he handed Him over to be crucified.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="40116s"></a>Jesus Is Mocked</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>27</b></font> Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole <i>Roman</i> cohort around Him.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> They stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> And after twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand; and they knelt down before Him and mocked Him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
<br><font size="-1">30</font> They spat on Him, and took the reed and <i>began</i> to beat Him on the head.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> After they had mocked Him, they took the <i>scarlet</i> robe off Him and put His <i>own</i> garments back on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>32</b></font> As they were coming out, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon, whom they pressed into service to bear His cross.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="40117s"></a>The Crucifixion</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>33</b></font> And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of a Skull,
<br><font size="-1">34</font> they gave Him wine to drink mixed with gall; and after tasting <i>it,</i> He was unwilling to drink.
<br><font size="-1"><b>35</b></font> And when they had crucified Him, they divided up His garments among themselves by casting lots.
<br><font size="-1">36</font> And sitting down, they <i>began</i> to keep watch over Him there.
<br><font size="-1">37</font> And above His head they put up the charge against Him which read, "THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
<br><font size="-1"><b>38</b></font> At that time two robbers *were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.
<br><font size="-1">39</font> And those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads
<br><font size="-1">40</font> and saying, "You who <i>are going to</i> destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross."
<br><font size="-1">41</font> In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking <i>Him</i> and saying,
<br><font size="-1">42</font> "He saved others; He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel; let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in Him.
<br><font size="-1">43</font> "H<font size="-1">E TRUSTS IN</font> G<font size="-1">OD</font>; <font size="-1">LET</font> G<font size="-1">OD RESCUE</font> <i>Him</i> now, <font size="-1">IF</font> H<font size="-1">E</font> <font size="-1">DELIGHTS IN</font> H<font size="-1">IM</font>; for He said, ''I am the Son of God.''&nbsp;"
<br><font size="-1">44</font> The robbers who had been crucified with Him were also insulting Him with the same words.
<br><font size="-1"><b>45</b></font> Now from the sixth hour darkness fell upon all the land until the ninth hour.
<br><font size="-1">46</font> About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, <font color="red">"E<font size="-1">LI</font>, E<font size="-1">LI</font>, <font size="-1">LAMA SABACHTHANI</font>?"</font> that is, <font color="red">"M<font size="-1">Y</font> G<font size="-1">OD</font>, M<font size="-1">Y</font> G<font size="-1">OD</font>, <font size="-1">WHY HAVE</font> Y<font size="-1">OU FORSAKEN</font> M<font size="-1">E</font>?"</font>
<br><font size="-1">47</font> And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, <i>began</i> saying, "This man is calling for Elijah."
<br><font size="-1">48</font> Immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink.
<br><font size="-1">49</font> But the rest <i>of them</i> said, "Let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him."
<br><font size="-1">50</font> And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.
<br><font size="-1">51</font> And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth shook and the rocks were split.
<br><font size="-1">52</font> The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;
<br><font size="-1">53</font> and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many.
<br><font size="-1">54</font> Now the centurion, and those who were with him keeping guard over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, became very frightened and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
<br><font size="-1"><b>55</b></font> Many women were there looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee while ministering to Him.
<br><font size="-1">56</font> Among them was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="40118s"></a>Jesus Is Buried</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>57</b></font> When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">58</font> This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given <i>to him.</i>
<br><font size="-1">59</font> And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
<br><font size="-1">60</font> and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away.
<br><font size="-1">61</font> And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave.
<br><font size="-1"><b>62</b></font> Now on the next day, the day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate,
<br><font size="-1">63</font> and said, "Sir, we remember that when He was still alive that deceiver said, ''After three days I <i>am to</i> rise again.''
<br><font size="-1">64</font> "Therefore, give orders for the grave to be made secure until the third day, otherwise His disciples may come and steal Him away and say to the people, ''He has risen from the dead,'' and the last deception will be worse than the first."
<br><font size="-1">65</font> Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go, make it <i>as</i> secure as you know how."
<br><font size="-1">66</font> And they went and made the grave secure, and along with the guard they set a seal on the stone.

<font size="-1">1</font> Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first <i>day</i> of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> And behold, a severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> The guards shook for fear of him and became like dead men.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> "He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where He was lying.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> "Go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead; and behold, He is going ahead of you into Galilee, there you will see Him; behold, I have told you."
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> And they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to report it to His disciples.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> And behold, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they came up and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Then Jesus *said to them, <font color="red">"Do not be afraid; go and take word to My brethren to leave for Galilee, and there they will see Me."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> Now while they were on their way, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> and said, "You are to say, ''His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.''
<br><font size="-1">14</font> "And if this should come to the governor''s ears, we will win him over and keep you out of trouble."
<br><font size="-1">15</font> And they took the money and did as they had been instructed; and this story was widely spread among the Jews, <i>and is</i> to this day.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="40120s"></a>The Great Commission</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> But the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> When they saw Him, they worshiped <i>Him;</i> but some were doubtful.

<br><font size="-1">4</font> John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> And all the country of Judea was going out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> John was clothed with camel''s hair and <i>wore</i> a leather belt around his waist, and his diet was locusts and wild honey.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> And he was preaching, and saying, "After me One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to stoop down and untie the thong of His sandals.

<br><font size="-1">11</font> and a voice came out of the heavens: "You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased."
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> Immediately the Spirit *impelled Him <i>to</i> <i>go</i> out into the wilderness.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> And He was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan; and He was with the wild beasts, and the angels were ministering to Him.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="413s"></a>Jesus Preaches in Galilee</i></b></font></p>

<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> As He was going along by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen.

<br><font size="-1">20</font> Immediately He called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went away to follow Him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>21</b></font> They *went into Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and <i>began</i> to teach.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> They were amazed at His teaching; for He was teaching them as <i>one</i> having authority, and not as the scribes.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
<br><font size="-1">24</font> saying, "What business do we have with each other, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are&#151;the Holy One of God!"
<br><font size="-1">25</font> And Jesus rebuked him, saying, <font color="red">"Be quiet, and come out of him!"</font>
<br><font size="-1">26</font> Throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> They were all amazed, so that they debated among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him."
<br><font size="-1">28</font> Immediately the news about Him spread everywhere into all the surrounding district of Galilee.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="414s"></a>Crowds Healed</i></b></font></p>

<br><font size="-1">31</font> And He came to her and raised her up, taking her by the hand, and the fever left her, and she waited on them.
<br><font size="-1"><b>32</b></font> When evening came, after the sun had set, they <i>began</i> bringing to Him all who were ill and those who were demon-possessed.

<br><font size="-1"><b>35</b></font> In the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left <i>the house,</i> and went away to a secluded place, and was praying there.
<br><font size="-1">36</font> Simon and his companions searched for Him;

<br><font size="-1">39</font> And He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out the demons.
<br><font size="-1"><b>40</b></font> And a leper *came to Jesus, beseeching Him and falling on his knees before Him, and saying, "If You are willing, You can make me clean."

<br><font size="-1">42</font> Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.
<br><font size="-1">43</font> And He sternly warned him and immediately sent him away,

<br><font size="-1">45</font> But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news around, to such an extent that Jesus could no longer publicly enter a city, but stayed out in unpopulated areas; and they were coming to Him from everywhere.

<br><font size="-1">10</font> for He had healed many, with the result that all those who had afflictions pressed around Him in order to touch Him.

<br><font size="-1">3</font> and he had his dwelling among the tombs. And no one was able to bind him anymore, even with a chain;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles broken in pieces, and no one was strong enough to subdue him.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Constantly, night and day, he was screaming among the tombs and in the mountains, and gashing himself with stones.

<br><font size="-1">16</font> Those who had seen it described to them how it had happened to the demon-possessed man, and <i>all</i> about the swine.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> And they began to implore Him to leave their region.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> As He was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed was imploring Him that he might accompany Him.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> And He did not let him, but He *said to him, <font color="red">"Go home to your people and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and <i>how</i> He had mercy on you."</font>

<br><font size="-1">23</font> and *implored Him earnestly, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death; <i>please</i> come and lay Your hands on her, so that she will get well and live."
<br><font size="-1">24</font> And He went off with him; and a large crowd was following Him and pressing in on Him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>25</b></font> A woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years,

<br><font size="-1">27</font> after hearing about Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind <i>Him</i> and touched His cloak.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> For she thought, "If I just touch His garments, I will get well."
<br><font size="-1">29</font> Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.

<br><font size="-1">32</font> And He looked around to see the woman who had done this.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> But the woman fearing and trembling, aware of what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth.

<br><font size="-1">37</font> And He allowed no one to accompany Him, except Peter and James and John the brother of James.

<font size="-1">1</font> The Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered around Him when they had come from Jerusalem,

<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> Six days later, Jesus *took with Him Peter and James and John, and *brought them up on a high mountain by themselves. And He was transfigured before them;

<br><font size="-1">4</font> Elijah appeared to them along with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.

<br><font size="-1">17</font> And one of the crowd answered Him, "Teacher, I brought You my son, possessed with a spirit which makes him mute;
<br><font size="-1">18</font> and whenever it seizes him, it slams him <i>to the ground</i> and he foams <i>at the mouth,</i> and grinds his teeth and stiffens out. I told Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not <i>do it.</i>"
<br><font size="-1">19</font> And He *answered them and *said, <font color="red">"O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him to Me!"</font>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now the Passover and Unleavened Bread were two days away; and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to seize Him by stealth and kill <i>Him;</i>
<br><font size="-1">2</font> for they were saying, "Not during the festival, otherwise there might be a riot of the people."
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> While He was in Bethany at the home of Simon the leper, and reclining <i>at the table,</i> there came a woman with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume of pure nard; <i>and</i> she broke the vial and poured it over His head.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> But some were indignantly <i>remarking</i> to one another, "Why has this perfume been wasted?
<br><font size="-1">5</font> "For this perfume might have been sold for over three hundred denarii, and <i>the money</i> given to the poor." And they were scolding her.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But Jesus said, <font color="red">"Let her alone; why do you bother her? She has done a good deed to Me.</font>
<br><font size="-1">7</font> <font color="red">"For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you wish you can do good to them; but you do not always have Me.</font>
<br><font size="-1">8</font> <font color="red">"She has done what she could; she has anointed My body beforehand for the burial.</font>
<br><font size="-1">9</font> <font color="red">"Truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of in memory of her."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests in order to betray Him to them.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> They were glad when they heard <i>this,</i> and promised to give him money. And he <i>began</i> seeking how to betray Him at an opportune time.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4146s"></a>The Last Passover</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover <i>lamb</i> was being sacrificed, His disciples *said to Him, "Where do You want us to go and prepare for You to eat the Passover?"
<br><font size="-1">13</font> And He *sent two of His disciples and *said to them, <font color="red">"Go into the city, and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him;</font>
<br><font size="-1">14</font> <font color="red">and wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, ''The Teacher says, "Where is My guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?"&nbsp;''</font>
<br><font size="-1">15</font> <font color="red">"And he himself will show you a large upper room furnished <i>and</i> ready; prepare for us there."</font>
<br><font size="-1">16</font> The disciples went out and came to the city, and found <i>it</i> just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover.
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> When it was evening He *came with the twelve.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> As they were reclining <i>at the table</i> and eating, Jesus said, <font color="red">"Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me&#151;one who is eating with Me."</font>
<br><font size="-1">19</font> They began to be grieved and to say to Him one by one, "Surely not I?"
<br><font size="-1">20</font> And He said to them, <font color="red">"<i>It is</i> one of the twelve, one who dips with Me in the bowl.</font>
<br><font size="-1">21</font> <font color="red">"For the Son of Man <i>is to</i> go just as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! <i>It would have been</i> good for that man if he had not been born."</font>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4147s"></a>The Lord''s Supper</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> While they were eating, He took <i>some</i> bread, and after a blessing He broke <i>it,</i> and gave <i>it</i> to them, and said, <font color="red">"Take <i>it;</i> this is My body."</font>
<br><font size="-1">23</font> And when He had taken a cup <i>and</i> given thanks, He gave <i>it</i> to them, and they all drank from it.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> And He said to them, <font color="red">"This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.</font>
<br><font size="-1">25</font> <font color="red">"Truly I say to you, I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>26</b></font> After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
<br><font size="-1"><b>27</b></font> And Jesus *said to them, <font color="red">"You will all fall away, because it is written, ''I <font size="-1">WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP SHALL BE SCATTERED</font>.''</font>
<br><font size="-1">28</font> <font color="red">"But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee."</font>
<br><font size="-1">29</font> But Peter said to Him, "<i>Even</i> though all may fall away, yet I will not."
<br><font size="-1">30</font> And Jesus *said to him, <font color="red">"Truly I say to you, that this very night, before a rooster crows twice, you yourself will deny Me three times."</font>
<br><font size="-1">31</font> But <i>Peter</i> kept saying insistently, "<i>Even</i> if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!" And they all were saying the same thing also.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4148s"></a>Jesus in Gethsemane</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>32</b></font> They *came to a place named Gethsemane; and He *said to His disciples, <font color="red">"Sit here until I have prayed."</font>
<br><font size="-1">33</font> And He *took with Him Peter and James and John, and began to be very distressed and troubled.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> And He *said to them, <font color="red">"My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death; remain here and keep watch."</font>
<br><font size="-1">35</font> And He went a little beyond <i>them,</i> and fell to the ground and <i>began</i> to pray that if it were possible, the hour might pass Him by.
<br><font size="-1">36</font> And He was saying, <font color="red">"Abba! Father! All things are possible for You; remove this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what You will."</font>
<br><font size="-1">37</font> And He *came and *found them sleeping, and *said to Peter, <font color="red">"Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?</font>
<br><font size="-1">38</font> <font color="red">"Keep watching and praying that you may not come into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."</font>
<br><font size="-1">39</font> Again He went away and prayed, saying the same words.
<br><font size="-1">40</font> And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to answer Him.
<br><font size="-1">41</font> And He *came the third time, and *said to them, <font color="red">"Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough; the hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</font>
<br><font size="-1">42</font> <font color="red">"Get up, let us be going; behold, the one who betrays Me is at hand!"</font>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4149s"></a>Betrayal and Arrest</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>43</b></font> Immediately while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, *came up accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs, <i>who were</i> from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
<br><font size="-1">44</font> Now he who was betraying Him had given them a signal, saying, "Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him and lead Him away under guard."
<br><font size="-1">45</font> After coming, Judas immediately went to Him, saying, "Rabbi!" and kissed Him.
<br><font size="-1">46</font> They laid hands on Him and seized Him.
<br><font size="-1">47</font> But one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear.
<br><font size="-1">48</font> And Jesus said to them, <font color="red">"Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me, as <i>you would</i> against a robber?</font>
<br><font size="-1">49</font> <font color="red">"Every day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me; but <i>this has</i> <i>taken place</i> to fulfill the Scriptures."</font>
<br><font size="-1">50</font> And they all left Him and fled.
<br><font size="-1"><b>51</b></font> A young man was following Him, wearing <i>nothing but</i> a linen sheet over <i>his</i> naked <i>body;</i> and they *seized him.
<br><font size="-1">52</font> But he pulled free of the linen sheet and escaped naked.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4150s"></a>Jesus before His Accusers</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>53</b></font> They led Jesus away to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes *gathered together.
<br><font size="-1">54</font> Peter had followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers and warming himself at the fire.
<br><font size="-1">55</font> Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, and they were not finding any.
<br><font size="-1">56</font> For many were giving false testimony against Him, but their testimony was not consistent.
<br><font size="-1">57</font> Some stood up and <i>began</i> to give false testimony against Him, saying,
<br><font size="-1">58</font> "We heard Him say, ''I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.''&nbsp;"
<br><font size="-1">59</font> Not even in this respect was their testimony consistent.
<br><font size="-1">60</font> The high priest stood up <i>and came</i> forward and questioned Jesus, saying, "Do You not answer? What is it that these men are testifying against You?"
<br><font size="-1">61</font> But He kept silent and did not answer. Again the high priest was questioning Him, and saying to Him, "Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed <i>One?</i>"
<br><font size="-1">62</font> And Jesus said, <font color="red">"I am; and you shall see <font size="-1">THE</font> S<font size="-1">ON OF</font> M<font size="-1">AN SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF</font> P<font size="-1">OWER</font>, and <font size="-1">COMING WITH THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN</font>."</font>
<br><font size="-1">63</font> Tearing his clothes, the high priest *said, "What further need do we have of witnesses?
<br><font size="-1">64</font> "You have heard the blasphemy; how does it seem to you?" And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death.
<br><font size="-1">65</font> Some began to spit at Him, and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him with their fists, and to say to Him, "Prophesy!" And the officers received Him with slaps <i>in the face.</i>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4151s"></a>Peter''s Denials</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>66</b></font> As Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant-girls of the high priest *came,
<br><font size="-1">67</font> and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and *said, "You also were with Jesus the Nazarene."
<br><font size="-1">68</font> But he denied <i>it,</i> saying, "I neither know nor understand what you are talking about." And he went out onto the porch.
<br><font size="-1">69</font> The servant-girl saw him, and began once more to say to the bystanders, "This is <i>one</i> of them!"
<br><font size="-1">70</font> But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders were again saying to Peter, "Surely you are <i>one</i> of them, for you are a Galilean too."
<br><font size="-1">71</font> But he began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man you are talking about!"
<br><font size="-1">72</font> Immediately a rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had made the remark to him, <font color="red">"Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times."</font> And he began to weep.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4152s"></a>Jesus before Pilate</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Early in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes and the whole Council, immediately held a consultation; and binding Jesus, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Pilate questioned Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?" And He *answered him, <font color="red">"<i>It is as</i> you say."</font>
<br><font size="-1">3</font> The chief priests <i>began</i> to accuse Him harshly.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Then Pilate questioned Him again, saying, "Do You not answer? See how many charges they bring against You!"
<br><font size="-1">5</font> But Jesus made no further answer; so Pilate was amazed.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> Now at <i>the</i> feast he used to release for them <i>any</i> one prisoner whom they requested.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> The man named Barabbas had been imprisoned with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the insurrection.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> The crowd went up and began asking him <i>to</i> <i>do</i> as he had been accustomed to do for them.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For he was aware that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> But the chief priests stirred up the crowd <i>to ask</i> him to release Barabbas for them instead.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Answering again, Pilate said to them, "Then what shall I do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?"
<br><font size="-1">13</font> They shouted back, "Crucify Him!"
<br><font size="-1">14</font> But Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has He done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify Him!"
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Wishing to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them, and after having Jesus scourged, he handed Him over to be crucified.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4153s"></a>Jesus Is Mocked</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> The soldiers took Him away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium), and they *called together the whole <i>Roman</i> cohort.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> They *dressed Him up in purple, and after twisting a crown of thorns, they put it on Him;
<br><font size="-1">18</font> and they began to acclaim Him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
<br><font size="-1">19</font> They kept beating His head with a reed, and spitting on Him, and kneeling and bowing before Him.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> After they had mocked Him, they took the purple robe off Him and put His <i>own</i> garments on Him. And they *led Him out to crucify Him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>21</b></font> They *pressed into service a passer-by coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), to bear His cross.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4154s"></a>The Crucifixion</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> Then they *brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> They tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He did not take it.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> And they *crucified Him, and *divided up His garments among themselves, casting lots for them <i>to decide</i> what each man should take.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> It was the third hour when they crucified Him.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> The inscription of the charge against Him read, "THE KING OF THE JEWS."
<br><font size="-1"><b>27</b></font> They *crucified two robbers with Him, one on His right and one on His left.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> [And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "And He was numbered with transgressors."]
<br><font size="-1">29</font> Those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Ha! You who <i>are</i> <i>going to</i> destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,
<br><font size="-1">30</font> save Yourself, and come down from the cross!"
<br><font size="-1">31</font> In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes, were mocking <i>Him</i> among themselves and saying, "He saved others; He cannot save Himself.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> "Let <i>this</i> Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, so that we may see and believe!" Those who were crucified with Him were also insulting Him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>33</b></font> When the sixth hour came, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, <font color="red">"E<font size="-1">LOI</font>, E<font size="-1">LOI</font>, <font size="-1">LAMA SABACHTHANI</font>?"</font> which is translated, <font color="red">"M<font size="-1">Y</font> G<font size="-1">OD</font>, M<font size="-1">Y</font> G<font size="-1">OD</font>, <font size="-1">WHY HAVE</font> Y<font size="-1">OU FORSAKEN</font> M<font size="-1">E</font>?"</font>
<br><font size="-1">35</font> When some of the bystanders heard it, they <i>began</i> saying, "Behold, He is calling for Elijah."
<br><font size="-1">36</font> Someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink, saying, "Let us see whether Elijah will come to take Him down."
<br><font size="-1">37</font> And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed His last.
<br><font size="-1">38</font> And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
<br><font size="-1">39</font> When the centurion, who was standing right in front of Him, saw the way He breathed His last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"
<br><font size="-1"><b>40</b></font> There were also <i>some</i> women looking on from a distance, among whom <i>were</i> Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the Less and Joses, and Salome.
<br><font size="-1">41</font> When He was in Galilee, they used to follow Him and minister to Him; and <i>there were</i> many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.

<br><font size="-1">43</font> Joseph of Arimathea came, a prominent member of the Council, who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God; and he gathered up courage and went in before Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">44</font> Pilate wondered if He was dead by this time, and summoning the centurion, he questioned him as to whether He was already dead.
<br><font size="-1">45</font> And ascertaining this from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
<br><font size="-1">46</font> Joseph bought a linen cloth, took Him down, wrapped Him in the linen cloth and laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
<br><font size="-1">47</font> Mary Magdalene and Mary the <i>mother</i> of Joses were looking on <i>to see</i> where He was laid.

<font size="-1">1</font> When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the <i>mother</i> of James, and Salome, bought spices, so that they might come and anoint Him.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Very early on the first day of the week, they *came to the tomb when the sun had risen.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> They were saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?"
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Looking up, they *saw that the stone had been rolled away, although it was extremely large.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting at the right, wearing a white robe; and they were amazed.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> And he *said to them, "Do not be amazed; you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen; He is not here; behold, <i>here is</i> the place where they laid Him.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> "But go, tell His disciples and Peter, ''He is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see Him, just as He told you.''&nbsp;"
<br><font size="-1">8</font> They went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had gripped them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> [Now after He had risen early on the first day of the week, He first appeared to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> She went and reported to those who had been with Him, while they were mourning and weeping.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they refused to believe it.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> After that, He appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking along on their way to the country.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> They went away and reported it to the others, but they did not believe them either.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4157s"></a>The Disciples Commissioned</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> Afterward He appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining <i>at the table;</i> and He reproached them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen Him after He had risen.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> And He said to them, <font color="red">"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.</font>

<font size="-1">1</font> Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile an account of the things accomplished among us,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> just as they were handed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> it seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from the beginning, to write <i>it</i> out for you in consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> so that you may know the exact truth about the things you have been taught.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="422s"></a>Birth of John the Baptist Foretold</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah; and he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> They were both righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> Now it happened <i>that</i> while he was performing his priestly service before God in the <i>appointed</i> order of his division,
<br><font size="-1">9</font> according to the custom of the priestly office, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> And the whole multitude of the people were in prayer outside at the hour of the incense offering.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the altar of incense.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Zacharias was troubled when he saw <i>the angel,</i> and fear gripped him.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will give him the name John.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> "You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.

<br><font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> Zacharias said to the angel, "How will I know this <i>for certain?</i> For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years."
<br><font size="-1">19</font> The angel answered and said to him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> "And behold, you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day when these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time."
<br><font size="-1"><b>21</b></font> The people were waiting for Zacharias, and were wondering at his delay in the temple.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> But when he came out, he was unable to speak to them; and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he kept making signs to them, and remained mute.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> When the days of his priestly service were ended, he went back home.
<br><font size="-1"><b>24</b></font> After these days Elizabeth his wife became pregnant, and she kept herself in seclusion for five months, saying,

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="423s"></a>Jesus'' Birth Foretold</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>26</b></font> Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth,
<br><font size="-1">27</font> to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the descendants of David; and the virgin''s name was Mary.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> And coming in, he said to her, "Greetings, favored one! The Lord <i>is</i> with you."
<br><font size="-1">29</font> But she was very perplexed at <i>this</i> statement, and kept pondering what kind of salutation this was.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> The angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary; for you have found favor with God.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> "And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> "He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David;
<br><font size="-1">33</font> and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end."
<br><font size="-1">34</font> Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I am a virgin?"
<br><font size="-1">35</font> The angel answered and said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God.
<br><font size="-1">36</font> "And behold, even your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age; and she who was called barren is now in her sixth month.
<br><font size="-1">37</font> "For nothing will be impossible with God."
<br><font size="-1">38</font> And Mary said, "Behold, the bondslave of the Lord; may it be done to me according to your word." And the angel departed from her.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="424s"></a>Mary Visits Elizabeth</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>39</b></font> Now at this time Mary arose and went in a hurry to the hill country, to a city of Judah,
<br><font size="-1">40</font> and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
<br><font size="-1">41</font> When Elizabeth heard Mary''s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
<br><font size="-1">42</font> And she cried out with a loud voice and said, "Blessed <i>are</i> you among women, and blessed <i>is</i> the fruit of your womb!
<br><font size="-1">43</font> "And how has it <i>happened</i> to me, that the mother of my Lord would come to me?

<br><font size="-1"><b>56</b></font> And Mary stayed with her about three months, and <i>then</i> returned to her home.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="426s"></a>John Is Born</i></b></font></p>

<br><font size="-1">61</font> And they said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who is called by that name."
<br><font size="-1">62</font> And they made signs to his father, as to what he wanted him called.
<br><font size="-1">63</font> And he asked for a tablet and wrote as follows, "His name is John." And they were all astonished.
<br><font size="-1">64</font> And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue <i>loosed,</i> and he <i>began</i> to speak in praise of God.
<br><font size="-1">65</font> Fear came on all those living around them; and all these matters were being talked about in all the hill country of Judea.
<br><font size="-1">66</font> All who heard them kept them in mind, saying, "What then will this child <i>turn out to</i> be?" For the hand of the Lord was certainly with him.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="427s"></a>Zacharias''s Prophecy</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>67</b></font> And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:

<br><font size="-1">3</font> And everyone was on his way to register for the census, each to his own city.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> in order to register along with Mary, who was engaged to him, and was with child.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> While they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him in cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> In the same region there were <i>some</i> shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people;
<br><font size="-1">11</font> for today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> "This <i>will be</i> a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."
<br><font size="-1">13</font> And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> "Glory to God in the highest, <br>And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased."
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds <i>began</i> saying to one another, "Let us go straight to Bethlehem then, and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us."
<br><font size="-1">16</font> So they came in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the baby as He lay in the manger.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> When they had seen this, they made known the statement which had been told them about this Child.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> And all who heard it wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> But Mary treasured all these things, pondering them in her heart.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> The shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as had been told them.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="429s"></a>Jesus Presented at the Temple</i></b></font></p>

<br><font size="-1">24</font> and to offer a sacrifice according to what was said in the Law of the Lord, "A <font size="-1">PAIR OF TURTLEDOVES OR TWO YOUNG PIGEONS</font>."
<br><font size="-1"><b>25</b></font> And there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him.

<br><font size="-1">27</font> And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to carry out for Him the custom of the Law,
<br><font size="-1">28</font> then he took Him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,

<font size="-1">1</font> Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> And he came into all the district around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, <br>"T<font size="-1">HE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS</font>, <br>''M<font size="-1">AKE READY THE WAY OF THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD</font>, <br>M<font size="-1">AKE</font> H<font size="-1">IS PATHS STRAIGHT</font>.

<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> So he <i>began</i> saying to the crowds who were going out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
<br><font size="-1">8</font> "Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, ''We have Abraham for our father,'' for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> "Indeed the axe is already laid at the root of the trees; so every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> And the crowds were questioning him, saying, "Then what shall we do?"
<br><font size="-1">11</font> And he would answer and say to them, "The man who has two tunics is to share with him who has none; and he who has food is to do likewise."
<br><font size="-1">12</font> And <i>some</i> tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, "Teacher, what shall we do?"
<br><font size="-1">13</font> And he said to them, "Collect no more than what you have been ordered to."
<br><font size="-1">14</font> <i>Some</i> soldiers were questioning him, saying, "And <i>what about</i> us, what shall we do?" And he said to them, "Do not take money from anyone by force, or accuse <i>anyone</i> falsely, and be content with your wages."
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> Now while the people were in a state of expectation and all were wondering in their hearts about John, as to whether he was the Christ,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> John answered and said to them all, "As for me, I baptize you with water; but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to untie the thong of His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> "His winnowing fork is in His hand to thoroughly clear His threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into His barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
<br><font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> So with many other exhortations he preached the gospel to the people.

<br><font size="-1">25</font> <font color="red">"But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Those who are splendidly clothed and live in luxury are <i>found</i> in royal palaces!</font>
<br><font size="-1">26</font> <font color="red">"But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and one who is more than a prophet.</font>
<br><font size="-1">27</font> <font color="red">"This is the one about whom it is written,</font> <br><font color="red">''B<font size="-1">EHOLD</font>, I <font size="-1">SEND</font> M<font size="-1">Y MESSENGER</font> <font size="-1">AHEAD OF</font> Y<font size="-1">OU</font>,</font> <br><font color="red">W<font size="-1">HO WILL PREPARE</font> Y<font size="-1">OUR WAY BEFORE</font> Y<font size="-1">OU</font>.''</font>
<br><font size="-1">28</font> <font color="red">"I say to you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."</font>
<br><font size="-1">29</font> When all the people and the tax collectors heard <i>this,</i> they acknowledged God''s justice, having been baptized with the baptism of John.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God''s purpose for themselves, not having been baptized by John.
<br><font size="-1"><b>31</b></font> <font color="red">"To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like?</font>
<br><font size="-1">32</font> <font color="red">"They are like children who sit in the market place and call to one another, and they say, ''We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.''</font>
<br><font size="-1">33</font> <font color="red">"For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, ''He has a demon!''</font>

<br><font size="-1"><b>36</b></font> Now one of the Pharisees was requesting Him to dine with him, and He entered the Pharisee''s house and reclined <i>at the table.</i>
<br><font size="-1">37</font> And there was a woman in the city who was a sinner; and when she learned that He was reclining <i>at the table</i> in the Pharisee''s house, she brought an alabaster vial of perfume,
<br><font size="-1">38</font> and standing behind <i>Him</i> at His feet, weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears, and kept wiping them with the hair of her head, and kissing His feet and anointing them with the perfume.
<br><font size="-1">39</font> Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet He would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching Him, that she is a sinner."

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4229s"></a>Parable of the Sower</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> When a large crowd was coming together, and those from the various cities were journeying to Him, He spoke by way of a parable:
<br><font size="-1">5</font> <font color="red">"The sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell beside the road, and it was trampled under foot and the birds of the air ate it up.</font>
<br><font size="-1">6</font> <font color="red">"Other <i>seed</i> fell on rocky <i>soil,</i> and as soon as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</font>
<br><font size="-1">7</font> <font color="red">"Other <i>seed</i> fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew up with it and choked it out.</font>
<br><font size="-1">8</font> <font color="red">"Other <i>seed</i> fell into the good soil, and grew up, and produced a crop a hundred times as great."</font> As He said these things, He would call out, <font color="red">"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> His disciples <i>began</i> questioning Him as to what this parable meant.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> And He said, <font color="red">"To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest <i>it is</i> in parables, so that <font size="-1">SEEING THEY MAY NOT SEE</font>, <font size="-1">AND HEARING THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND</font>.</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> <font color="red">"Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God.</font>
<br><font size="-1">12</font> <font color="red">"Those beside the road are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they will not believe and be saved.</font>
<br><font size="-1">13</font> <font color="red">"Those on the rocky <i>soil are</i> those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no <i>firm</i> root; they believe for a while, and in time of temptation fall away.</font>
<br><font size="-1">14</font> <font color="red">"The <i>seed</i> which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with worries and riches and pleasures of <i>this</i> life, and bring no fruit to maturity.</font>
<br><font size="-1">15</font> <font color="red">"But the <i>seed</i> in the good soil, these are the ones who have heard the word in an honest and good heart, and hold it fast, and bear fruit with perseverance.</font>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4230s"></a>Parable of the Lamp</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> <font color="red">"Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it over with a container, or puts it under a bed; but he puts it on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light.</font>
<br><font size="-1">17</font> <font color="red">"For nothing is hidden that will not become evident, nor <i>anything</i> secret that will not be known and come to light.</font>
<br><font size="-1">18</font> <font color="red">"So take care how you listen; for whoever has, to him <i>more</i> shall be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> And His mother and brothers came to Him, and they were unable to get to Him because of the crowd.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> And it was reported to Him, "Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, wishing to see You."
<br><font size="-1">21</font> But He answered and said to them, <font color="red">"My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it."</font>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4231s"></a>Jesus Stills the Sea</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> Now on one of <i>those</i> days Jesus and His disciples got into a boat, and He said to them, <font color="red">"Let us go over to the other side of the lake."</font> So they launched out.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> But as they were sailing along He fell asleep; and a fierce gale of wind descended on the lake, and they <i>began</i> to be swamped and to be in danger.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> They came to Jesus and woke Him up, saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing!" And He got up and rebuked the wind and the surging waves, and they stopped, and it became calm.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> And He said to them, <font color="red">"Where is your faith?"</font> They were fearful and amazed, saying to one another, "Who then is this, that He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him?"
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4232s"></a>The Demoniac Cured</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>26</b></font> Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> And when He came out onto the land, He was met by a man from the city who was possessed with demons; and who had not put on any clothing for a long time, and was not living in a house, but in the tombs.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> Seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell before Him, and said in a loud voice, "What business do we have with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me."
<br><font size="-1">29</font> For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had seized him many times; and he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, and <i>yet</i> he would break his bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> And Jesus asked him, <font color="red">"What is your name?"</font> And he said, "Legion"; for many demons had entered him.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> They were imploring Him not to command them to go away into the abyss.
<br><font size="-1"><b>32</b></font> Now there was a herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain; and <i>the demons</i> implored Him to permit them to enter the swine. And He gave them permission.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> And the demons came out of the man and entered the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
<br><font size="-1"><b>34</b></font> When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran away and reported it in the city and <i>out</i> in the country.
<br><font size="-1">35</font> <i>The people</i> went out to see what had happened; and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting down at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they became frightened.
<br><font size="-1">36</font> Those who had seen it reported to them how the man who was demon-possessed had been made well.
<br><font size="-1">37</font> And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes and the surrounding district asked Him to leave them, for they were gripped with great fear; and He got into a boat and returned.
<br><font size="-1">38</font> But the man from whom the demons had gone out was begging Him that he might accompany Him; but He sent him away, saying,
<br><font size="-1">39</font> <font color="red">"Return to your house and describe what great things God has done for you."</font> So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4233s"></a>Miracles of Healing</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>40</b></font> And as Jesus returned, the people welcomed Him, for they had all been waiting for Him.
<br><font size="-1">41</font> And there came a man named Jairus, and he was an official of the synagogue; and he fell at Jesus'' feet, and <i>began</i> to implore Him to come to his house;
<br><font size="-1">42</font> for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. But as He went, the crowds were pressing against Him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>43</b></font> And a woman who had a hemorrhage for twelve years, and could not be healed by anyone,
<br><font size="-1">44</font> came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak, and immediately her hemorrhage stopped.
<br><font size="-1">45</font> And Jesus said, <font color="red">"Who is the one who touched Me?"</font> And while they were all denying it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing in on You."
<br><font size="-1">46</font> But Jesus said, <font color="red">"Someone did touch Me, for I was aware that power had gone out of Me."</font>
<br><font size="-1">47</font> When the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling and fell down before Him, and declared in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched Him, and how she had been immediately healed.
<br><font size="-1">48</font> And He said to her, <font color="red">"Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>49</b></font> While He was still speaking, someone *came from <i>the house of</i> the synagogue official, saying, "Your daughter has died; do not trouble the Teacher anymore."
<br><font size="-1">50</font> But when Jesus heard <i>this,</i> He answered him, <font color="red">"Do not be afraid <i>any longer;</i> only believe, and she will be made well."</font>
<br><font size="-1">51</font> When He came to the house, He did not allow anyone to enter with Him, except Peter and John and James, and the girl''s father and mother.
<br><font size="-1">52</font> Now they were all weeping and lamenting for her; but He said, <font color="red">"Stop weeping, for she has not died, but is asleep."</font>
<br><font size="-1">53</font> And they <i>began</i> laughing at Him, knowing that she had died.
<br><font size="-1">54</font> He, however, took her by the hand and called, saying, <font color="red">"Child, arise!"</font>
<br><font size="-1">55</font> And her spirit returned, and she got up immediately; and He gave orders for <i>something</i> to be given her to eat.
<br><font size="-1">56</font> Her parents were amazed; but He instructed them to tell no one what had happened.

<font size="-1">1</font> And He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases.

<br><font size="-1">3</font> And He said to them, <font color="red">"Take nothing for <i>your</i> journey, neither a staff, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not <i>even</i> have two tunics apiece.</font>

<br><font size="-1">6</font> Departing, they <i>began</i> going throughout the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was happening; and he was greatly perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,

<br><font size="-1">9</font> Herod said, "I myself had John beheaded; but who is this man about whom I hear such things?" And he kept trying to see Him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> When the apostles returned, they gave an account to Him of all that they had done. Taking them with Him, He withdrew by Himself to a city called Bethsaida.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> But the crowds were aware of this and followed Him; and welcoming them, He <i>began</i> speaking to them about the kingdom of God and curing those who had need of healing.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4235s"></a>Five Thousand Fed</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> Now the day was ending, and the twelve came and said to Him, "Send the crowd away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging and get something to eat; for here we are in a desolate place."
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But He said to them, <font color="red">"You give them <i>something</i> to eat!"</font> And they said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people."
<br><font size="-1">14</font> (For there were about five thousand men.) And He said to His disciples, <font color="red">"Have them sit down <i>to eat</i> in groups of about fifty each."</font>
<br><font size="-1">15</font> They did so, and had them all sit down.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed them, and broke <i>them,</i> and kept giving <i>them</i> to the disciples to set before the people.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> And they all ate and were satisfied; and the broken pieces which they had left over were picked up, twelve baskets <i>full.</i>
<br><font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> And it happened that while He was praying alone, the disciples were with Him, and He questioned them, saying, <font color="red">"Who do the people say that I am?"</font>
<br><font size="-1">19</font> They answered and said, "John the Baptist, and others <i>say</i> Elijah; but others, that one of the prophets of old has risen again."
<br><font size="-1">20</font> And He said to them, <font color="red">"But who do you say that I am?"</font> And Peter answered and said, "The Christ of God."
<br><font size="-1">21</font> But He warned them and instructed <i>them</i> not to tell this to anyone,
<br><font size="-1">22</font> saying, <font color="red">"The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed and be raised up on the third day."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> And He was saying to <i>them</i> all, <font color="red">"If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow Me.</font>
<br><font size="-1">24</font> <font color="red">"For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake, he is the one who will save it.</font>
<br><font size="-1">25</font> <font color="red">"For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits himself?</font>
<br><font size="-1">26</font> <font color="red">"For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory, and <i>the glory</i> of the Father and of the holy angels.</font>
<br><font size="-1">27</font> <font color="red">"But I say to you truthfully, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God."</font>

<br><font size="-1">29</font> And while He was praying, the appearance of His face became different, and His clothing <i>became</i> white <i>and</i> gleaming.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> And behold, two men were talking with Him; and they were Moses and Elijah,
<br><font size="-1">31</font> who, appearing in glory, were speaking of His departure which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> Now Peter and his companions had been overcome with sleep; but when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men standing with Him.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> And as these were leaving Him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles: one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah"&#151;not realizing what he was saying.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> While he was saying this, a cloud formed and <i>began</i> to overshadow them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
<br><font size="-1">35</font> Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is My Son, <i>My</i> Chosen One; listen to Him!"
<br><font size="-1">36</font> And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent, and reported to no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.
<br><font size="-1"><b>37</b></font> On the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Him.

<br><font size="-1">39</font> and a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly screams, and it throws him into a convulsion with foaming <i>at the mouth;</i> and only with difficulty does it leave him, mauling him <i>as it leaves.</i>
<br><font size="-1">40</font> "I begged Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not."
<br><font size="-1">41</font> And Jesus answered and said, <font color="red">"You unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here."</font>
<br><font size="-1">42</font> While he was still approaching, the demon slammed him <i>to the ground</i> and threw him into a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy and gave him back to his father.
<br><font size="-1">43</font> And they were all amazed at the greatness of God.
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> But while everyone was marveling at all that He was doing, He said to His disciples,

<br><font size="-1">45</font> But they did not understand this statement, and it was concealed from them so that they would not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this statement.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4237s"></a>The Test of Greatness</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>46</b></font> An argument started among them as to which of them might be the greatest.

<br><font size="-1">15</font> Now one of them, when he saw that he had been healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> and he fell on his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him. And he was a Samaritan.

<br><font size="-1">3</font> <font color="red">"There was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him, saying, ''Give me legal protection from my opponent.''</font>

<br><font size="-1">6</font> And the Lord said, <font color="red">"Hear what the unrighteous judge *said;</font>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4268s"></a>The Pharisee and the Publican</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> And He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and viewed others with contempt:
<br><font size="-1">10</font> <font color="red">"Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</font>
<br><font size="-1">11</font> <font color="red">"The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself: ''God, I thank You that I am not like other people: swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.</font>
<br><font size="-1">12</font> <font color="red">''I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all that I get.''</font>
<br><font size="-1">13</font> <font color="red">"But the tax collector, standing some distance away, was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, ''God, be merciful to me, the sinner!''</font>
<br><font size="-1">14</font> <font color="red">"I tell you, this man went to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> And they were bringing even their babies to Him so that He would touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they <i>began</i> rebuking them.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> But Jesus called for them, saying, <font color="red">"Permit the children to come to Me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</font>
<br><font size="-1">17</font> <font color="red">"Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it <i>at all.</i>"</font>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4269s"></a>The Rich Young Ruler</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> A ruler questioned Him, saying, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"

<br><font size="-1">20</font> <font color="red">"You know the commandments, ''D<font size="-1">O NOT COMMIT ADULTERY</font>, D<font size="-1">O NOT MURDER</font>, D<font size="-1">O NOT STEAL</font>, D<font size="-1">O NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS</font>, H<font size="-1">ONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER</font>.''&nbsp;"</font>
<br><font size="-1">21</font> And he said, "All these things I have kept from <i>my</i> youth."
<br><font size="-1">22</font> When Jesus heard <i>this,</i> He said to him, <font color="red">"One thing you still lack; sell all that you possess and distribute it to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."</font>
<br><font size="-1">23</font> But when he had heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> And Jesus looked at him and said, <font color="red">"How hard it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!</font>
<br><font size="-1">25</font> <font color="red">"For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</font>
<br><font size="-1">26</font> They who heard it said, "Then who can be saved?"
<br><font size="-1">27</font> But He said, <font color="red">"The things that are impossible with people are possible with God."</font>

<br><font size="-1"><b>31</b></font> Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, <font color="red">"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things which are written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished.</font>

<br><font size="-1">34</font> But the disciples understood none of these things, and <i>the meaning of</i> this statement was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend the things that were said.

<br><font size="-1">3</font> Zaccheus was trying to see who Jesus was, and was unable because of the crowd, for he was small in stature.

<br><font size="-1">12</font> So He said, <font color="red">"A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and <i>then</i> return.</font>
<br><font size="-1">13</font> <font color="red">"And he called ten of his slaves, and gave them ten minas and said to them, ''Do business <i>with this</i> until I come <i>back.</i>''</font>

<br><font size="-1">15</font> <font color="red">"When he returned, after receiving the kingdom, he ordered that these slaves, to whom he had given the money, be called to him so that he might know what business they had done.</font>
<br><font size="-1">16</font> <font color="red">"The first appeared, saying, ''Master, your mina has made ten minas more.''</font>
<br><font size="-1">17</font> <font color="red">"And he said to him, ''Well done, good slave, because you have been faithful in a very little thing, you are to be in authority over ten cities.''</font>
<br><font size="-1">18</font> <font color="red">"The second came, saying, ''Your mina, master, has made five minas.''</font>
<br><font size="-1">19</font> <font color="red">"And he said to him also, ''And you are to be over five cities.''</font>
<br><font size="-1">20</font> <font color="red">"Another came, saying, ''Master, here is your mina, which I kept put away in a handkerchief;</font>
<br><font size="-1">21</font> <font color="red">for I was afraid of you, because you are an exacting man; you take up what you did not lay down and reap what you did not sow.''</font>

<br><font size="-1">24</font> <font color="red">"Then he said to the bystanders, ''Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.''</font>
<br><font size="-1">25</font> <font color="red">"And they said to him, ''Master, he has ten minas <i>already.</i>''</font>
<br><font size="-1">26</font> <font color="red">"I tell you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.</font>

<br><font size="-1">34</font> They said, "The Lord has need of it."
<br><font size="-1">35</font> They brought it to Jesus, and they threw their coats on the colt and put Jesus <i>on it.</i>

<br><font size="-1">60</font> But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are talking about." Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
<br><font size="-1">61</font> The Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had told him, <font color="red">"Before a rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times."</font>
<br><font size="-1">62</font> And he went out and wept bitterly.

<br><font size="-1">29</font> <font color="red">"For behold, the days are coming when they will say, ''Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.''</font>

<font size="-1"><b>33</b></font> When they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> But Jesus was saying, <font color="red">"Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing."</font> And they cast lots, dividing up His garments among themselves.
<br><font size="-1">35</font> And the people stood by, looking on. And even the rulers were sneering at Him, saying, "He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God, His Chosen One."
<br><font size="-1">36</font> The soldiers also mocked Him, coming up to Him, offering Him sour wine,
<br><font size="-1">37</font> and saying, "If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!"
<br><font size="-1">38</font> Now there was also an inscription above Him, "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
<br><font size="-1"><b>39</b></font> One of the criminals who were hanged <i>there</i> was hurling abuse at Him, saying, "Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!"
<br><font size="-1">40</font> But the other answered, and rebuking him said, "Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?
<br><font size="-1">41</font> "And we indeed <i>are suffering</i> justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong."
<br><font size="-1">42</font> And he was saying, "Jesus, remember me when You come in Your kingdom!"
<br><font size="-1">43</font> And He said to him, <font color="red">"Truly I say to you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>44</b></font> It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour,

<br><font size="-1">6</font> "He is not here, but He has risen. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,

<br><font size="-1">8</font> And they remembered His words,

<br><font size="-1">10</font> Now they were Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the <i>mother</i> of James; also the other women with them were telling these things to the apostles.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> But these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they would not believe them.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he *saw the linen wrappings only; and he went away to his home, marveling at what had happened.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4296s"></a>The Road to Emmaus</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> While they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself approached and <i>began</i> traveling with them.

<br><font size="-1">17</font> And He said to them, <font color="red">"What are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking?"</font> And they stood still, looking sad.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> One <i>of them,</i> named Cleopas, answered and said to Him, "Are You the only one visiting Jerusalem and unaware of the things which have happened here in these days?"
<br><font size="-1">19</font> And He said to them, <font color="red">"What things?"</font> And they said to Him, "The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people,

<br><font size="-1">21</font> "But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since these things happened.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> "But also some women among us amazed us. When they were at the tomb early in the morning,
<br><font size="-1">23</font> and did not find His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> "Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just exactly as the women also had said; but Him they did not see."
<br><font size="-1">25</font> And He said to them, <font color="red">"O foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</font>
<br><font size="-1">26</font> <font color="red">"Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?"</font>
<br><font size="-1">27</font> Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures.
<br><font size="-1"><b>28</b></font> And they approached the village where they were going, and He acted as though He were going farther.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> But they urged Him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is <i>getting</i> toward evening, and the day is now nearly over." So He went in to stay with them.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> When He had reclined <i>at the table</i> with them, He took the bread and blessed <i>it,</i> and breaking <i>it,</i> He <i>began</i> giving <i>it</i> to them.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished from their sight.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> They said to one another, "Were not our hearts burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was explaining the Scriptures to us?"
<br><font size="-1">33</font> And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven and those who were with them,

<br><font size="-1">40</font> And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.
<br><font size="-1">41</font> While they still could not believe <i>it</i> because of their joy and amazement, He said to them, <font color="red">"Have you anything here to eat?"</font>
<br><font size="-1">42</font> They gave Him a piece of a broiled fish;
<br><font size="-1">43</font> and He took it and ate <i>it</i> before them.
<br><font size="-1"><b>44</b></font> Now He said to them, <font color="red">"These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled."</font>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="431s"></a>The Deity of Jesus Christ</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> He was in the beginning with God.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="432s"></a>The Witness John</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> He came as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that all might believe through him.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> He was not the Light, but <i>he came</i> to testify about the Light.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> There was the true Light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, <i>even</i> to those who believe in His name,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="433s"></a>The Word Made Flesh</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> John *testified about Him and cried out, saying, "This was He of whom I said, ''He who comes after me has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.''&nbsp;"
<br><font size="-1">16</font> For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained <i>Him.</i>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="434s"></a>The Testimony of John</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> This is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"
<br><font size="-1">20</font> And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ."
<br><font size="-1">21</font> They asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" And he *said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" And he answered, "No."
<br><font size="-1">22</font> Then they said to him, "Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?"
<br><font size="-1">23</font> He said, "I am <font size="-1">A VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS</font>, ''M<font size="-1">AKE STRAIGHT THE WAY OF THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD</font>,'' as Isaiah the prophet said."
<br><font size="-1"><b>24</b></font> Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> They asked him, and said to him, "Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"
<br><font size="-1">26</font> John answered them saying, "I baptize in water, <i>but</i> among you stands One whom you do not know.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> "<i>It is</i> He who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie."
<br><font size="-1">28</font> These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
<br><font size="-1"><b>29</b></font> The next day he *saw Jesus coming to him and *said, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
<br><font size="-1">30</font> "This is He on behalf of whom I said, ''After me comes a Man who has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.''
<br><font size="-1">31</font> "I did not recognize Him, but so that He might be manifested to Israel, I came baptizing in water."
<br><font size="-1">32</font> John testified saying, "I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> "I did not recognize Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ''He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.''
<br><font size="-1">34</font> "I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God."

<font size="-1"><b>35</b></font> Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,

<br><font size="-1">37</font> The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">38</font> And Jesus turned and saw them following, and *said to them, <font color="red">"What do you seek?"</font> They said to Him, "Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?"
<br><font size="-1">39</font> He *said to them, <font color="red">"Come, and you will see."</font> So they came and saw where He was staying; and they stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.
<br><font size="-1">40</font> One of the two who heard John <i>speak</i> and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter''s brother.
<br><font size="-1">41</font> He *found first his own brother Simon and *said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which translated means Christ).
<br><font size="-1">42</font> He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, <font color="red">"You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas"</font> (which is translated Peter).
<br><font size="-1"><b>43</b></font> The next day He purposed to go into Galilee, and He *found Philip. And Jesus *said to him, <font color="red">"Follow Me."</font>
<br><font size="-1">44</font> Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
<br><font size="-1">45</font> Philip *found Nathanael and *said to him, "We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and <i>also</i> the Prophets wrote&#151;Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
<br><font size="-1">46</font> Nathanael said to him, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Philip *said to him, "Come and see."
<br><font size="-1">47</font> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and *said of him, <font color="red">"Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!"</font>
<br><font size="-1">48</font> Nathanael *said to Him, "How do You know me?" Jesus answered and said to him, <font color="red">"Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."</font>
<br><font size="-1">49</font> Nathanael answered Him, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel."
<br><font size="-1">50</font> Jesus answered and said to him, <font color="red">"Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these."</font>
<br><font size="-1">51</font> And He *said to him, <font color="red">"Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."</font>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="436s"></a>Miracle at Cana</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there;
<br><font size="-1">2</font> and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus *said to Him, "They have no wine."
<br><font size="-1">4</font> And Jesus *said to her, <font color="red">"Woman, what does that have to do with us? My hour has not yet come."</font>
<br><font size="-1">5</font> His mother *said to the servants, "Whatever He says to you, do it."
<br><font size="-1">6</font> Now there were six stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing twenty or thirty gallons each.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Jesus *said to them, <font color="red">"Fill the waterpots with water."</font> So they filled them up to the brim.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> And He *said to them, <font color="red">"Draw <i>some</i> out now and take it to the headwaiter."</font> So they took it <i>to him.</i>
<br><font size="-1">9</font> When the headwaiter tasted the water which had become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter *called the bridegroom,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> and *said to him, "Every man serves the good wine first, and when <i>the people</i> have drunk freely, <i>then he serves</i> the poorer <i>wine;</i> <i>but</i> you have kept the good wine until now."
<br><font size="-1">11</font> This beginning of <i>His</i> signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and <i>His</i> brothers and His disciples; and they stayed there a few days.

<font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> And He found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated <i>at their tables.</i>
<br><font size="-1">15</font> And He made a scourge of cords, and drove <i>them</i> all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables;
<br><font size="-1">16</font> and to those who were selling the doves He said, <font color="red">"Take these things away; stop making My Father''s house a place of business."</font>
<br><font size="-1">17</font> His disciples remembered that it was written, "Z<font size="-1">EAL FOR</font> Y<font size="-1">OUR HOUSE WILL CONSUME ME</font>."
<br><font size="-1">18</font> The Jews then said to Him, "What sign do You show us as your authority for doing these things?"
<br><font size="-1">19</font> Jesus answered them, <font color="red">"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."</font>
<br><font size="-1">20</font> The Jews then said, "It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?"
<br><font size="-1">21</font> But He was speaking of the temple of His body.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> So when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.
<br><font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, observing His signs which He was doing.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to them, for He knew all men,
<br><font size="-1">25</font> and because He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man.

<font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He was spending time with them and baptizing.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and <i>people</i> were coming and were being baptized&#151;
<br><font size="-1">24</font> for John had not yet been thrown into prison.
<br><font size="-1"><b>25</b></font> Therefore there arose a discussion on the part of John''s disciples with a Jew about purification.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4310s"></a>Jesus Goes to Galilee</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
<br><font size="-1">2</font> (although Jesus Himself was not baptizing, but His disciples were),
<br><font size="-1">3</font> He left Judea and went away again into Galilee.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> And He had to pass through Samaria.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> So He *came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph;
<br><font size="-1">6</font> and Jacob''s well was there. So Jesus, being wearied from His journey, was sitting thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4311s"></a>The Woman of Samaria</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> There *came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus *said to her, <font color="red">"Give Me a drink."</font>
<br><font size="-1">8</font> For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Therefore the Samaritan woman *said to Him, "How is it that You, being a Jew, ask me for a drink since I am a Samaritan woman?" (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Jesus answered and said to her, <font color="red">"If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ''Give Me a drink,'' you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water."</font>
<br><font size="-1">11</font> She *said to Him, "Sir, You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep; where then do You get that living water?
<br><font size="-1">12</font> "You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself and his sons and his cattle?"
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Jesus answered and said to her, <font color="red">"Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again;</font>
<br><font size="-1">14</font> <font color="red">but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> The woman *said to Him, "Sir, give me this water, so I will not be thirsty nor come all the way here to draw."
<br><font size="-1">16</font> He *said to her, <font color="red">"Go, call your husband and come here."</font>
<br><font size="-1">17</font> The woman answered and said, "I have no husband." Jesus *said to her, <font color="red">"You have correctly said, ''I have no husband'';</font>
<br><font size="-1">18</font> <font color="red">for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly."</font>
<br><font size="-1">19</font> The woman *said to Him, "Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> "Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you <i>people</i> say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship."
<br><font size="-1">21</font> Jesus *said to her, <font color="red">"Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</font>
<br><font size="-1">22</font> <font color="red">"You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.</font>
<br><font size="-1">23</font> <font color="red">"But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers.</font>
<br><font size="-1">24</font> <font color="red">"God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."</font>
<br><font size="-1">25</font> The woman *said to Him, "I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when that One comes, He will declare all things to us."
<br><font size="-1">26</font> Jesus *said to her, <font color="red">"I who speak to you am <i>He.</i>"</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>27</b></font> At this point His disciples came, and they were amazed that He had been speaking with a woman, yet no one said, "What do You seek?" or, "Why do You speak with her?"
<br><font size="-1">28</font> So the woman left her waterpot, and went into the city and *said to the men,
<br><font size="-1">29</font> "Come, see a man who told me all the things that I <i>have</i> done; this is not the Christ, is it?"
<br><font size="-1">30</font> They went out of the city, and were coming to Him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>31</b></font> Meanwhile the disciples were urging Him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."
<br><font size="-1">32</font> But He said to them, <font color="red">"I have food to eat that you do not know about."</font>
<br><font size="-1">33</font> So the disciples were saying to one another, "No one brought Him <i>anything</i> to eat, did he?"
<br><font size="-1">34</font> Jesus *said to them, <font color="red">"My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to accomplish His work.</font>
<br><font size="-1">35</font> <font color="red">"Do you not say, ''There are yet four months, and <i>then</i> comes the harvest''? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look on the fields, that they are white for harvest.</font>
<br><font size="-1">36</font> <font color="red">"Already he who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for life eternal; so that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</font>

<br><font size="-1">38</font> <font color="red">"I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored and you have entered into their labor."</font>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4312s"></a>The Samaritans</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>39</b></font> From that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, "He told me all the things that I <i>have</i> done."
<br><font size="-1">40</font> So when the Samaritans came to Jesus, they were asking Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.
<br><font size="-1">41</font> Many more believed because of His word;
<br><font size="-1">42</font> and they were saying to the woman, "It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves and know that this One is indeed the Savior of the world."
<br><font size="-1"><b>43</b></font> After the two days He went forth from there into Galilee.
<br><font size="-1">44</font> For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
<br><font size="-1">45</font> So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves also went to the feast.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4313s"></a>Healing a Nobleman''s Son</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>46</b></font> Therefore He came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum.
<br><font size="-1">47</font> When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and was imploring <i>Him</i> to come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.
<br><font size="-1">48</font> So Jesus said to him, <font color="red">"Unless you <i>people</i> see signs and wonders, you <i>simply</i> will not believe."</font>
<br><font size="-1">49</font> The royal official *said to Him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
<br><font size="-1">50</font> Jesus *said to him, <font color="red">"Go; your son lives."</font> The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started off.
<br><font size="-1">51</font> As he was now going down, <i>his</i> slaves met him, saying that his son was living.
<br><font size="-1">52</font> So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. Then they said to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."
<br><font size="-1">53</font> So the father knew that <i>it was</i> at that hour in which Jesus said to him, <font color="red">"Your son lives"</font>; and he himself believed and his whole household.
<br><font size="-1">54</font> This is again a second sign that Jesus performed when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4314s"></a>The Healing at Bethesda</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep <i>gate</i> a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, [waiting for the moving of the waters;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool and stirred up the water; whoever then first, after the stirring up of the water, stepped in was made well from whatever disease with which he was afflicted.]
<br><font size="-1">5</font> A man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> When Jesus saw him lying <i>there,</i> and knew that he had already been a long time <i>in that condition,</i> He *said to him, <font color="red">"Do you wish to get well?"</font>
<br><font size="-1">7</font> The sick man answered Him, "Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am coming, another steps down before me."
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Jesus *said to him, <font color="red">"Get up, pick up your pallet and walk."</font>
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Immediately the man became well, and picked up his pallet and <i>began</i> to walk.
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> Now it was the Sabbath on that day.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> So the Jews were saying to the man who was cured, "It is the Sabbath, and it is not permissible for you to carry your pallet."
<br><font size="-1">11</font> But he answered them, "He who made me well was the one who said to me, <font color="red">''Pick up your pallet and walk.''</font>"
<br><font size="-1">12</font> They asked him, "Who is the man who said to you, <font color="red">''Pick up <i>your pallet</i> and walk''</font>?"
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in <i>that</i> place.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Afterward Jesus *found him in the temple and said to him, <font color="red">"Behold, you have become well; do not sin anymore, so that nothing worse happens to you."</font>
<br><font size="-1">15</font> The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> For this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> But He answered them, <font color="red">"My Father is working until now, and I Myself am working."</font>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4315s"></a>Jesus'' Equality with God</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">18</font> For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, <font color="red">"Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless <i>it is</i> something He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in like manner.</font>
<br><font size="-1">20</font> <font color="red">"For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and <i>the Father</i> will show Him greater works than these, so that you will marvel.</font>
<br><font size="-1">21</font> <font color="red">"For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes.</font>
<br><font size="-1">22</font> <font color="red">"For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son,</font>
<br><font size="-1">23</font> <font color="red">so that all will honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>24</b></font> <font color="red">"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.</font>

<br><font size="-1">26</font> <font color="red">"For just as the Father has life in Himself, even so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself;</font>
<br><font size="-1">27</font> <font color="red">and He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is <i>the</i> Son of Man.</font>
<br><font size="-1">28</font> <font color="red">"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,</font>

<font size="-1">1</font> After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (or Tiberias).
<br><font size="-1">2</font> A large crowd followed Him, because they saw the signs which He was performing on those who were sick.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Then Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat down with His disciples.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Therefore Jesus, lifting up His eyes and seeing that a large crowd was coming to Him, *said to Philip, <font color="red">"Where are we to buy bread, so that these may eat?"</font>
<br><font size="-1">6</font> This He was saying to test him, for He Himself knew what He was intending to do.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Philip answered Him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, for everyone to receive a little."
<br><font size="-1">8</font> One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter''s brother, *said to Him,
<br><font size="-1">9</font> "There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for so many people?"
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Jesus said, <font color="red">"Have the people sit down."</font> Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Jesus then took the loaves, and having given thanks, He distributed to those who were seated; likewise also of the fish as much as they wanted.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> When they were filled, He *said to His disciples, <font color="red">"Gather up the leftover fragments so that nothing will be lost."</font>
<br><font size="-1">13</font> So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Therefore when the people saw the sign which He had performed, they said, "This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world."
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4322s"></a>Jesus Walks on the Water</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> So Jesus, perceiving that they were intending to come and take Him by force to make Him king, withdrew again to the mountain by Himself alone.
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,
<br><font size="-1">17</font> and after getting into a boat, they <i>started to</i> cross the sea to Capernaum. It had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> The sea <i>began</i> to be stirred up because a strong wind was blowing.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> Then, when they had rowed about three or four miles, they *saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat; and they were frightened.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> But He *said to them, <font color="red">"It is I; do not be afraid."</font>
<br><font size="-1">21</font> So they were willing to receive Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.
<br><font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> The next day the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other small boat there, except one, and that Jesus had not entered with His disciples into the boat, but <i>that</i> His disciples had gone away alone.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> There came other small boats from Tiberias near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, "Rabbi, when did You get here?"
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4323s"></a>Words to the People</i></b></font></p>

<br><font size="-1">27</font> <font color="red">"Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you, for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal."</font>
<br><font size="-1">28</font> Therefore they said to Him, "What shall we do, so that we may work the works of God?"
<br><font size="-1">29</font> Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">"This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent."</font>
<br><font size="-1">30</font> So they said to Him, "What then do You do for a sign, so that we may see, and believe You? What work do You perform?

<br><font size="-1">32</font> Jesus then said to them, <font color="red">"Truly, truly, I say to you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of heaven.</font>
<br><font size="-1">33</font> <font color="red">"For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world."</font>
<br><font size="-1">34</font> Then they said to Him, "Lord, always give us this bread."

<font size="-1">1</font> After these things Jesus was walking in Galilee, for He was unwilling to walk in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was near.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Therefore His brothers said to Him, "Leave here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may see Your works which You are doing.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> "For no one does anything in secret when he himself seeks to be <i>known</i> publicly. If You do these things, show Yourself to the world."
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For not even His brothers were believing in Him.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> So Jesus *said to them, <font color="red">"My time is not yet here, but your time is always opportune.</font>
<br><font size="-1">7</font> <font color="red">"The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify of it, that its deeds are evil.</font>
<br><font size="-1">8</font> <font color="red">"Go up to the feast yourselves; I do not go up to this feast because My time has not yet fully come."</font>
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Having said these things to them, He stayed in Galilee.
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He Himself also went up, not publicly, but as if, in secret.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> So the Jews were seeking Him at the feast and were saying, "Where is He?"
<br><font size="-1">12</font> There was much grumbling among the crowds concerning Him; some were saying, "He is a good man"; others were saying, "No, on the contrary, He leads the people astray."
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Yet no one was speaking openly of Him for fear of the Jews.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and <i>began to</i> teach.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> The Jews then were astonished, saying, "How has this man become learned, having never been educated?"
<br><font size="-1">16</font> So Jesus answered them and said, <font color="red">"My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.</font>
<br><font size="-1">17</font> <font color="red">"If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God or <i>whether</i> I speak from Myself.</font>
<br><font size="-1">18</font> <font color="red">"He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who is seeking the glory of the One who sent Him, He is true, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> <font color="red">"Did not Moses give you the Law, and <i>yet</i> none of you carries out the Law? Why do you seek to kill Me?"</font>
<br><font size="-1">20</font> The crowd answered, "You have a demon! Who seeks to kill You?"
<br><font size="-1">21</font> Jesus answered them, <font color="red">"I did one deed, and you all marvel.</font>
<br><font size="-1">22</font> <font color="red">"For this reason Moses has given you circumcision (not because it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on <i>the</i> Sabbath you circumcise a man.</font>
<br><font size="-1">23</font> <font color="red">"If a man receives circumcision on <i>the</i> Sabbath so that the Law of Moses will not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made an entire man well on <i>the</i> Sabbath?</font>
<br><font size="-1">24</font> <font color="red">"Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>25</b></font> So some of the people of Jerusalem were saying, "Is this not the man whom they are seeking to kill?

<br><font size="-1">27</font> "However, we know where this man is from; but whenever the Christ may come, no one knows where He is from."
<br><font size="-1">28</font> Then Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, <font color="red">"You both know Me and know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.</font>
<br><font size="-1">29</font> <font color="red">"I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me."</font>
<br><font size="-1">30</font> So they were seeking to seize Him; and no man laid his hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> But many of the crowd believed in Him; and they were saying, "When the Christ comes, He will not perform more signs than those which this man has, will He?"
<br><font size="-1"><b>32</b></font> The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to seize Him.

<br><font size="-1">34</font> <font color="red">"You will seek Me, and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come."</font>
<br><font size="-1">35</font> The Jews then said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we will not find Him? He is not intending to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks, is He?
<br><font size="-1">36</font> "What is this statement that He said, <font color="red">''You will seek Me, and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come''</font>?"
<br><font size="-1"><b>37</b></font> Now on the last day, the great <i>day</i> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, <font color="red">"If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink.</font>

<br><font size="-1">47</font> The Pharisees then answered them, "You have not also been led astray, have you?

<br><font size="-1">22</font> His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> For this reason his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."
<br><font size="-1"><b>24</b></font> So a second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, "Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner."
<br><font size="-1">25</font> He then answered, "Whether He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see."
<br><font size="-1">26</font> So they said to him, "What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?"
<br><font size="-1">27</font> He answered them, "I told you already and you did not listen; why do you want to hear <i>it</i> again? You do not want to become His disciples too, do you?"
<br><font size="-1">28</font> They reviled him and said, "You are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> "We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where He is from."
<br><font size="-1">30</font> The man answered and said to them, "Well, here is an amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and <i>yet</i> He opened my eyes.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> "We know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> "Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> "If this man were not from God, He could do nothing."
<br><font size="-1">34</font> They answered him, "You were born entirely in sins, and are you teaching us?" So they put him out.

<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> A division occurred again among the Jews because of these words.

<font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> At that time the Feast of the Dedication took place at Jerusalem;

<br><font size="-1">24</font> The Jews then gathered around Him, and were saying to Him, "How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly."
<br><font size="-1">25</font> Jesus answered them, <font color="red">"I told you, and you do not believe; the works that I do in My Father''s name, these testify of Me.</font>

<br><font size="-1">33</font> The Jews answered Him, "For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out <i>to be</i> God."
<br><font size="-1">34</font> Jesus answered them, <font color="red">"Has it not been written in your Law, ''I <font size="-1">SAID</font>, <font size="-1">YOU ARE GODS</font>''?</font>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4337s"></a>The Death and Resurrection of Lazarus</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> So the sisters sent <i>word</i> to Him, saying, "Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick."
<br><font size="-1">4</font> But when Jesus heard <i>this,</i> He said, <font color="red">"This sickness is not to end in death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by it."</font>
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> So when He heard that he was sick, He then stayed two days <i>longer</i> in the place where He was.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Then after this He *said to the disciples, <font color="red">"Let us go to Judea again."</font>
<br><font size="-1">8</font> The disciples *said to Him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?"
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Jesus answered, <font color="red">"Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</font>
<br><font size="-1">10</font> <font color="red">"But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."</font>
<br><font size="-1">11</font> This He said, and after that He *said to them, <font color="red">"Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I go, so that I may awaken him out of sleep."</font>
<br><font size="-1">12</font> The disciples then said to Him, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He was speaking of literal sleep.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> So Jesus then said to them plainly, <font color="red">"Lazarus is dead,</font>
<br><font size="-1">15</font> <font color="red">and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let us go to him."</font>
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Therefore Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to <i>his</i> fellow disciples, "Let us also go, so that we may die with Him."
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off;
<br><font size="-1">19</font> and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning <i>their</i> brother.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him, but Mary stayed at the house.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> Martha then said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> "Even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You."
<br><font size="-1">23</font> Jesus *said to her, <font color="red">"Your brother will rise again."</font>
<br><font size="-1">24</font> Martha *said to Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day."
<br><font size="-1">25</font> Jesus said to her, <font color="red">"I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies,</font>
<br><font size="-1">26</font> <font color="red">and everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?"</font>
<br><font size="-1">27</font> She *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, <i>even</i> He who comes into the world."
<br><font size="-1"><b>28</b></font> When she had said this, she went away and called Mary her sister, saying secretly, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you."
<br><font size="-1">29</font> And when she heard it, she *got up quickly and was coming to Him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>30</b></font> Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and consoling her, when they saw that Mary got up quickly and went out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> Therefore, when Mary came where Jesus was, she saw Him, and fell at His feet, saying to Him, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died."
<br><font size="-1">33</font> When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her <i>also</i> weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled,
<br><font size="-1">34</font> and said, <font color="red">"Where have you laid him?"</font> They *said to Him, "Lord, come and see."
<br><font size="-1">35</font> Jesus wept.
<br><font size="-1">36</font> So the Jews were saying, "See how He loved him!"
<br><font size="-1">37</font> But some of them said, "Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have kept this man also from dying?"
<br><font size="-1"><b>38</b></font> So Jesus, again being deeply moved within, *came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.
<br><font size="-1">39</font> Jesus *said, <font color="red">"Remove the stone."</font> Martha, the sister of the deceased, *said to Him, "Lord, by this time there will be a stench, for he has been <i>dead</i> four days."
<br><font size="-1">40</font> Jesus *said to her, <font color="red">"Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?"</font>
<br><font size="-1">41</font> So they removed the stone. Then Jesus raised His eyes, and said, <font color="red">"Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.</font>
<br><font size="-1">42</font> <font color="red">"I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the people standing around I said it, so that they may believe that You sent Me."</font>
<br><font size="-1">43</font> When He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, <font color="red">"Lazarus, come forth."</font>
<br><font size="-1">44</font> The man who had died came forth, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus *said to them, <font color="red">"Unbind him, and let him go."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>45</b></font> Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what He had done, believed in Him.
<br><font size="-1">46</font> But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4338s"></a>Conspiracy to Kill Jesus</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>47</b></font> Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council, and were saying, "What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs.
<br><font size="-1">48</font> "If we let Him <i>go on</i> like this, all men will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."
<br><font size="-1">49</font> But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all,
<br><font size="-1">50</font> nor do you take into account that it is expedient for you that one man die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish."
<br><font size="-1">51</font> Now he did not say this on his own initiative, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,
<br><font size="-1">52</font> and not for the nation only, but in order that He might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.
<br><font size="-1">53</font> So from that day on they planned together to kill Him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>54</b></font> Therefore Jesus no longer continued to walk publicly among the Jews, but went away from there to the country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there He stayed with the disciples.
<br><font size="-1"><b>55</b></font> Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover to purify themselves.
<br><font size="-1">56</font> So they were seeking for Jesus, and were saying to one another as they stood in the temple, "What do you think; that He will not come to the feast at all?"
<br><font size="-1">57</font> Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he was to report it, so that they might seize Him.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4312"></a>JOHN: CHAPTER 12&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4339s"></a>Mary Anoints Jesus</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Jesus, therefore, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> So they made Him a supper there, and Martha was serving; but Lazarus was one of those reclining <i>at the</i> <i>table</i> with Him.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Mary then took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> But Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, who was intending to betray Him, *said,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> "Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to poor <i>people?</i>"
<br><font size="-1">6</font> Now he said this, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box, he used to pilfer what was put into it.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Therefore Jesus said, <font color="red">"Let her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of My burial.</font>
<br><font size="-1">8</font> <font color="red">"For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> The large crowd of the Jews then learned that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus'' sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He raised from the dead.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> But the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death also;
<br><font size="-1">11</font> because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and were believing in Jesus.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4340s"></a>Jesus Enters Jerusalem</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> On the next day the large crowd who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and <i>began</i> to shout, "Hosanna! B<font size="-1">LESSED IS</font> H<font size="-1">E WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD</font>, even the King of Israel."
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written,
<br><font size="-1">15</font> "F<font size="-1">EAR NOT</font>, <font size="-1">DAUGHTER OF</font> Z<font size="-1">ION</font>; <font size="-1">BEHOLD</font>, <font size="-1">YOUR</font> K<font size="-1">ING IS COMING</font>, <font size="-1">SEATED ON A DONKEY</font>''<font size="-1">S COLT</font>."
<br><font size="-1">16</font> These things His disciples did not understand at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him, and that they had done these things to Him.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> So the people, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, continued to testify <i>about Him.</i>
<br><font size="-1">18</font> For this reason also the people went and met Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> So the Pharisees said to one another, "You see that you are not doing any good; look, the world has gone after Him."
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4341s"></a>Greeks Seek Jesus</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>20</b></font> Now there were some Greeks among those who were going up to worship at the feast;

<br><font size="-1">22</font> Philip *came and *told Andrew; Andrew and Philip *came and *told Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> And Jesus *answered them, saying, <font color="red">"The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</font>
<br><font size="-1">24</font> <font color="red">"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</font>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4342s"></a>Jesus Foretells His Death</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>27</b></font> <font color="red">"Now My soul has become troubled; and what shall I say, ''Father, save Me from this hour''? But for this purpose I came to this hour.</font>
<br><font size="-1">28</font> <font color="red">"Father, glorify Your name."</font> Then a voice came out of heaven: "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."
<br><font size="-1">29</font> So the crowd <i>of people</i> who stood by and heard it were saying that it had thundered; others were saying, "An angel has spoken to Him."
<br><font size="-1">30</font> Jesus answered and said, <font color="red">"This voice has not come for My sake, but for your sakes.</font>
<br><font size="-1">31</font> <font color="red">"Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.</font>
<br><font size="-1">32</font> <font color="red">"And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself."</font>
<br><font size="-1">33</font> But He was saying this to indicate the kind of death by which He was to die.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> The crowd then answered Him, "We have heard out of the Law that the Christ is to remain forever; and how can You say, <font color="red">''The Son of Man must be lifted up''?</font> Who is this Son of Man?"
<br><font size="-1">35</font> So Jesus said to them, <font color="red">"For a little while longer the Light is among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.</font>
<br><font size="-1">36</font> <font color="red">"While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of Light."</font>
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> These things Jesus spoke, and He went away and hid Himself from them.
<br><font size="-1">37</font> But though He had performed so many signs before them, <i>yet</i> they were not believing in Him.
<br><font size="-1">38</font> <i>This was</i> to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet which he spoke: "L<font size="-1">ORD</font>, <font size="-1">WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT</font>? A<font size="-1">ND TO WHOM HAS THE ARM OF THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD BEEN REVEALED</font>?"
<br><font size="-1">39</font> For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah said again,

<br><font size="-1">41</font> These things Isaiah said because he saw His glory, and he spoke of Him.
<br><font size="-1">42</font> Nevertheless many even of the rulers believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing <i>Him,</i> for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue;
<br><font size="-1">43</font> for they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>44</b></font> And Jesus cried out and said, <font color="red">"He who believes in Me, does not believe in Me but in Him who sent Me.</font>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4343s"></a>The Lord''s Supper</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing that His hour had come that He would depart out of this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> During supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, <i>the son</i> of Simon, to betray Him,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> <i>Jesus,</i> knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come forth from God and was going back to God,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> *got up from supper, and *laid aside His garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4344s"></a>Jesus Washes the Disciples'' Feet</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">5</font> Then He *poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples'' feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> So He *came to Simon Peter. He *said to Him, "Lord, do You wash my feet?"
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Jesus answered and said to him, <font color="red">"What I do you do not realize now, but you will understand hereafter."</font>
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Peter *said to Him, "Never shall You wash my feet!" Jesus answered him, <font color="red">"If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me."</font>
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Simon Peter *said to Him, "Lord, <i>then wash</i> not only my feet, but also my hands and my head."
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Jesus *said to him, <font color="red">"He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all <i>of you.</i>"</font>
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For He knew the one who was betraying Him; for this reason He said, <font color="red">"Not all of you are clean."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> So when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments and reclined <i>at the table</i> again, He said to them, <font color="red">"Do you know what I have done to you?</font>
<br><font size="-1">13</font> <font color="red">"You call Me Teacher and Lord; and you are right, for <i>so</i> I am.</font>
<br><font size="-1">14</font> <font color="red">"If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another''s feet.</font>
<br><font size="-1">15</font> <font color="red">"For I gave you an example that you also should do as I did to you.</font>
<br><font size="-1">16</font> <font color="red">"Truly, truly, I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor <i>is</i> one who is sent greater than the one who sent him.</font>
<br><font size="-1">17</font> <font color="red">"If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.</font>
<br><font size="-1">18</font> <font color="red">"I do not speak of all of you. I know the ones I have chosen; but <i>it is</i> that the Scripture may be fulfilled, ''H<font size="-1">E WHO EATS</font> M<font size="-1">Y BREAD HAS LIFTED UP HIS HEEL AGAINST</font> M<font size="-1">E</font>.''</font>
<br><font size="-1">19</font> <font color="red">"From now on I am telling you before <i>it</i> comes to pass, so that when it does occur, you may believe that I am <i>He.</i></font>
<br><font size="-1">20</font> <font color="red">"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me."</font>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4345s"></a>Jesus Predicts His Betrayal</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>21</b></font> When Jesus had said this, He became troubled in spirit, and testified and said, <font color="red">"Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you will betray Me."</font>
<br><font size="-1">22</font> The disciples <i>began</i> looking at one another, at a loss <i>to know</i> of which one He was speaking.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> There was reclining on Jesus'' bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> So Simon Peter *gestured to him, and *said to him, "Tell <i>us</i> who it is of whom He is speaking."
<br><font size="-1">25</font> He, leaning back thus on Jesus'' bosom, *said to Him, "Lord, who is it?"
<br><font size="-1">26</font> Jesus then *answered, <font color="red">"That is the one for whom I shall dip the morsel and give it to him."</font> So when He had dipped the morsel, He *took and *gave it to Judas, <i>the son</i> of Simon Iscariot.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> After the morsel, Satan then entered into him. Therefore Jesus *said to him, <font color="red">"What you do, do quickly."</font>
<br><font size="-1">28</font> Now no one of those reclining <i>at the table</i> knew for what purpose He had said this to him.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> For some were supposing, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus was saying to him, "Buy the things we have need of for the feast"; or else, that he should give something to the poor.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> So after receiving the morsel he went out immediately; and it was night.
<br><font size="-1"><b>31</b></font> Therefore when he had gone out, Jesus *said, <font color="red">"Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him;</font>
<br><font size="-1">32</font> <font color="red">if God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.</font>

<br><font size="-1">35</font> <font color="red">"By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>36</b></font> Simon Peter *said to Him, "Lord, where are You going?" Jesus answered, <font color="red">"Where I go, you cannot follow Me now; but you will follow later."</font>
<br><font size="-1">37</font> Peter *said to Him, "Lord, why can I not follow You right now? I will lay down my life for You."
<br><font size="-1">38</font> Jesus *answered, <font color="red">"Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, a rooster will not crow until you deny Me three times.</font>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4359s"></a>Judas Betrays Jesus</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His disciples over the ravine of the Kidron, where there was a garden, in which He entered with His disciples.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Now Judas also, who was betraying Him, knew the place, for Jesus had often met there with His disciples.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Judas then, having received the <i>Roman</i> cohort and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, *came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> So Jesus, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth and *said to them, <font color="red">"Whom do you seek?"</font>
<br><font size="-1">5</font> They answered Him, "Jesus the Nazarene." He *said to them, <font color="red">"I am <i>He.</i>"</font> And Judas also, who was betraying Him, was standing with them.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> So when He said to them, <font color="red">"I am <i>He,</i>"</font> they drew back and fell to the ground.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Therefore He again asked them, <font color="red">"Whom do you seek?"</font> And they said, "Jesus the Nazarene."
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Jesus answered, <font color="red">"I told you that I am <i>He;</i> so if you seek Me, let these go their way,"</font>
<br><font size="-1">9</font> to fulfill the word which He spoke, <font color="red">"Of those whom You have given Me I lost not one."</font>
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Simon Peter then, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest''s slave, and cut off his right ear; and the slave''s name was Malchus.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> So Jesus said to Peter, <font color="red">"Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?"</font>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4360s"></a>Jesus before the Priests</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> So the <i>Roman</i> cohort and the commander and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound Him,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> and led Him to Annas first; for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die on behalf of the people.
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> Simon Peter was following Jesus, and <i>so</i> <i>was</i> another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter in.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Then the slave-girl who kept the door *said to Peter, "You are not also <i>one</i> of this man''s disciples, are you?" He *said, "I am not."
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Now the slaves and the officers were standing <i>there,</i> having made a charcoal fire, for it was cold and they were warming themselves; and Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself.
<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> The high priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples, and about His teaching.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> Jesus answered him, <font color="red">"I have spoken openly to the world; I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and I spoke nothing in secret.</font>
<br><font size="-1">21</font> <font color="red">"Why do you question Me? Question those who have heard what I spoke to them; they know what I said."</font>
<br><font size="-1">22</font> When He had said this, one of the officers standing nearby struck Jesus, saying, "Is that the way You answer the high priest?"
<br><font size="-1">23</font> Jesus answered him, <font color="red">"If I have spoken wrongly, testify of the wrong; but if rightly, why do you strike Me?"</font>
<br><font size="-1">24</font> So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4361s"></a>Peter''s Denial of Jesus</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>25</b></font> Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, "You are not also <i>one</i> of His disciples, are you?" He denied <i>it,</i> and said, "I am not."
<br><font size="-1">26</font> One of the slaves of the high priest, being a relative of the one whose ear Peter cut off, *said, "Did I not see you in the garden with Him?"
<br><font size="-1">27</font> Peter then denied <i>it</i> again, and immediately a rooster crowed.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4362s"></a>Jesus before Pilate</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>28</b></font> Then they *led Jesus from Caiaphas into the Praetorium, and it was early; and they themselves did not enter into the Praetorium so that they would not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> Therefore Pilate went out to them and *said, "What accusation do you bring against this Man?"
<br><font size="-1">30</font> They answered and said to him, "If this Man were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him to you."
<br><font size="-1">31</font> So Pilate said to them, "Take Him yourselves, and judge Him according to your law." The Jews said to him, "We are not permitted to put anyone to death,"
<br><font size="-1">32</font> to fulfill the word of Jesus which He spoke, signifying by what kind of death He was about to die.
<br><font size="-1"><b>33</b></font> Therefore Pilate entered again into the Praetorium, and summoned Jesus and said to Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?"
<br><font size="-1">34</font> Jesus answered, <font color="red">"Are you saying this on your own initiative, or did others tell you about Me?"</font>
<br><font size="-1">35</font> Pilate answered, "I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered You to me; what have You done?"
<br><font size="-1">36</font> Jesus answered, <font color="red">"My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not of this realm."</font>
<br><font size="-1">37</font> Therefore Pilate said to Him, "So You are a king?" Jesus answered, <font color="red">"You say <i>correctly</i> that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice."</font>
<br><font size="-1">38</font> Pilate *said to Him, "What is truth?"
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and *said to them, "I find no guilt in Him.
<br><font size="-1">39</font> "But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover; do you wish then that I release for you the King of the Jews?"
<br><font size="-1">40</font> So they cried out again, saying, "Not this Man, but Barabbas." Now Barabbas was a robber.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4319"></a>JOHN: CHAPTER 19&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4363s"></a>The Crown of Thorns</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Pilate then took Jesus and scourged Him.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and put a purple robe on Him;
<br><font size="-1">3</font> and they <i>began</i> to come up to Him and say, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and to give Him slaps <i>in the face.</i>
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Pilate came out again and *said to them, "Behold, I am bringing Him out to you so that you may know that I find no guilt in Him."
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Jesus then came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. <i>Pilate</i> *said to them, "Behold, the Man!"
<br><font size="-1">6</font> So when the chief priests and the officers saw Him, they cried out saying, "Crucify, crucify!" Pilate *said to them, "Take Him yourselves and crucify Him, for I find no guilt in Him."
<br><font size="-1">7</font> The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by that law He ought to die because He made Himself out <i>to</i> <i>be</i> the Son of God."
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> Therefore when Pilate heard this statement, he was <i>even</i> more afraid;
<br><font size="-1">9</font> and he entered into the Praetorium again and *said to Jesus, "Where are You from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> So Pilate *said to Him, "You do not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You, and I have authority to crucify You?"
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Jesus answered, <font color="red">"You would have no authority over Me, unless it had been given you from above; for this reason he who delivered Me to you has <i>the</i> greater sin."</font>
<br><font size="-1">12</font> As a result of this Pilate made efforts to release Him, but the Jews cried out saying, "If you release this Man, you are no friend of Caesar; everyone who makes himself out <i>to be</i> a king opposes Caesar."
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> Therefore when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. And he *said to the Jews, "Behold, your King!"
<br><font size="-1">15</font> So they cried out, "Away with <i>Him,</i> away with <i>Him,</i> crucify Him!" Pilate *said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4364s"></a>The Crucifixion</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">16</font> So he then handed Him over to them to be crucified.
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> They took Jesus, therefore, and He went out, bearing His own cross, to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> There they crucified Him, and with Him two other men, one on either side, and Jesus in between.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It was written, "JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
<br><font size="-1">20</font> Therefore many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin <i>and</i> in Greek.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> So the chief priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate, "Do not write, ''The King of the Jews''; but that He said, ''I am King of the Jews.''&nbsp;"
<br><font size="-1">22</font> Pilate answered, "What I have written I have written."
<br><font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His outer garments and made four parts, a part to every soldier and <i>also</i> the tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> So they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, <i>to decide</i> whose it shall be"; <i>this was</i> to fulfill the Scripture: "T<font size="-1">HEY</font> <font size="-1">DIVIDED</font> M<font size="-1">Y OUTER GARMENTS AMONG THEM</font>, <font size="-1">AND FOR</font> M<font size="-1">Y CLOTHING THEY CAST</font> <font size="-1">LOTS</font>."
<br><font size="-1">25</font> Therefore the soldiers did these things.
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> But standing by the cross of Jesus were His mother, and His mother''s sister, Mary the <i>wife</i> of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> When Jesus then saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He *said to His mother, <font color="red">"Woman, behold, your son!"</font>
<br><font size="-1">27</font> Then He *said to the disciple, <font color="red">"Behold, your mother!"</font> From that hour the disciple took her into his own <i>household.</i>
<br><font size="-1"><b>28</b></font> After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been accomplished, to fulfill the Scripture, *said, <font color="red">"I am thirsty."</font>
<br><font size="-1">29</font> A jar full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon <i>a branch</i> <i>of</i> hyssop and brought it up to His mouth.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, <font color="red">"It is finished!"</font> And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4365s"></a>Care of the Body of Jesus</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>31</b></font> Then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and <i>that</i> they might be taken away.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> So the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with Him;
<br><font size="-1">33</font> but coming to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
<br><font size="-1">35</font> And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe.
<br><font size="-1">36</font> For these things came to pass to fulfill the Scripture, "N<font size="-1">OT A BONE OF</font> H<font size="-1">IM SHALL BE</font> <font size="-1">BROKEN</font>."
<br><font size="-1">37</font> And again another Scripture says, "T<font size="-1">HEY SHALL LOOK ON</font> H<font size="-1">IM WHOM THEY PIERCED</font>."
<br><font size="-1"><b>38</b></font> After these things Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but a secret <i>one</i> for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate granted permission. So he came and took away His body.
<br><font size="-1">39</font> Nicodemus, who had first come to Him by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds <i>weight.</i>
<br><font size="-1">40</font> So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.
<br><font size="-1">41</font> Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.
<br><font size="-1">42</font> Therefore because of the Jewish day of preparation, since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4320"></a>JOHN: CHAPTER 20&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4366s"></a>The Empty Tomb</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now on the first <i>day</i> of the week Mary Magdalene *came early to the tomb, while it *was still dark, and *saw the stone <i>already</i> taken away from the tomb.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> So she *ran and *came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and *said to them, "They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him."
<br><font size="-1">3</font> So Peter and the other disciple went forth, and they were going to the tomb.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> The two were running together; and the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter and came to the tomb first;
<br><font size="-1">5</font> and stooping and looking in, he *saw the linen wrappings lying <i>there;</i> but he did not go in.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> And so Simon Peter also *came, following him, and entered the tomb; and he *saw the linen wrappings lying <i>there,</i>
<br><font size="-1">7</font> and the face-cloth which had been on His head, not lying with the linen wrappings, but rolled up in a place by itself.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb then also entered, and he saw and believed.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> So the disciples went away again to their own homes.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> But Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping; and so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb;
<br><font size="-1">12</font> and she *saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been lying.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> And they *said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She *said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him."
<br><font size="-1">14</font> When she had said this, she turned around and *saw Jesus standing <i>there,</i> and did not know that it was Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Jesus *said to her, <font color="red">"Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?"</font> Supposing Him to be the gardener, she *said to Him, "Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away."
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Jesus *said to her, <font color="red">"Mary!"</font> She turned and *said to Him in Hebrew, "Rabboni!" (which means, Teacher).
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Jesus *said to her, <font color="red">"Stop clinging to Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, ''I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.''&nbsp;"</font>
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Mary Magdalene *came, announcing to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord," and <i>that</i> He had said these things to her.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4367s"></a>Jesus among His Disciples</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> So when it was evening on that day, the first <i>day</i> of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and *said to them, <font color="red">"Peace <i>be</i> with you."</font>
<br><font size="-1">20</font> And when He had said this, He showed them both His hands and His side. The disciples then rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> So Jesus said to them again, <font color="red">"Peace <i>be</i> with you; as the Father has sent Me, I also send you."</font>
<br><font size="-1">22</font> And when He had said this, He breathed on them and *said to them, <font color="red">"Receive the Holy Spirit.</font>
<br><font size="-1">23</font> <font color="red">"If you forgive the sins of any, <i>their sins</i> have been forgiven them; if you retain the <i>sins</i> of any, they have been retained."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>24</b></font> But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> So the other disciples were saying to him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe."
<br><font size="-1"><b>26</b></font> After eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus *came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and said, <font color="red">"Peace <i>be</i> with you."</font>
<br><font size="-1">27</font> Then He *said to Thomas, <font color="red">"Reach here with your finger, and see My hands; and reach here your hand and put it into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing."</font>
<br><font size="-1">28</font> Thomas answered and said to Him, "My Lord and my God!"

<font size="-1"><b>30</b></font> Therefore many other signs Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4369s"></a>Jesus Appears at the Sea of Galilee</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> After these things Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and He manifested <i>Himself</i> in this way.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the <i>sons</i> of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Simon Peter *said to them, "I am going fishing." They *said to him, "We will also come with you." They went out and got into the boat; and that night they caught nothing.
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> But when the day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> So Jesus *said to them, <font color="red">"Children, you do not have any fish, do you?"</font> They answered Him, "No."
<br><font size="-1">6</font> And He said to them, <font color="red">"Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat and you will find <i>a catch.</i>"</font> So they cast, and then they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved *said to Peter, "It is the Lord." So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment on (for he was stripped <i>for work),</i> and threw himself into the sea.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but about one hundred yards away, dragging the net <i>full</i> of fish.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> So when they got out on the land, they *saw a charcoal fire <i>already</i> laid and fish placed on it, and bread.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Jesus *said to them, <font color="red">"Bring some of the fish which you have now caught."</font>
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4370s"></a>Jesus Provides</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">12</font> Jesus *said to them, <font color="red">"Come <i>and</i> have breakfast."</font> None of the disciples ventured to question Him, "Who are You?" knowing that it was the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Jesus *came and *took the bread and *gave <i>it</i> to them, and the fish likewise.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after He was raised from the dead.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4371s"></a>The Love Motivation</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus *said to Simon Peter, <font color="red">"Simon, <i>son</i> of John, do you love Me more than these?"</font> He *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I love You." He *said to him, <font color="red">"Tend My lambs."</font>
<br><font size="-1">16</font> He *said to him again a second time, <font color="red">"Simon, <i>son</i> of John, do you love Me?"</font> He *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I love You." He *said to him, <font color="red">"Shepherd My sheep."</font>
<br><font size="-1">17</font> He *said to him the third time, <font color="red">"Simon, <i>son</i> of John, do you love Me?"</font> Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, <font color="red">"Do you love Me?"</font> And he said to Him, "Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You." Jesus *said to him, <font color="red">"Tend My sheep.</font>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4372s"></a>Our Times Are in His Hand</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">18</font> <font color="red">"Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you used to gird yourself and walk wherever you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands and someone else will gird you, and bring you where you do not wish to <i>go.</i>"</font>
<br><font size="-1">19</font> Now this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He *said to him, <font color="red">"Follow Me!"</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>20</b></font> Peter, turning around, *saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following <i>them;</i> the one who also had leaned back on His bosom at the supper and said, "Lord, who is the one who betrays You?"
<br><font size="-1">21</font> So Peter seeing him *said to Jesus, "Lord, and what about this man?"
<br><font size="-1">22</font> Jesus *said to him, <font color="red">"If I want him to remain until I come, what <i>is that</i> to you? You follow Me!"</font>
<br><font size="-1">23</font> Therefore this saying went out among the brethren that that disciple would not die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but <i>only,</i> <font color="red">"If I want him to remain until I come, what <i>is that</i> to you?"</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>24</b></font> This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true.
<br><font size="-1"><b>25</b></font> And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they *were written in detail, I suppose that even the world itself *would not contain the books that *would be written.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="441s"></a>Introduction</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> The first account I composed, Theophilus, about all that Jesus began to do and teach,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> until the day when He was taken up <i>to heaven,</i> after He had by the Holy Spirit given orders to the apostles whom He had chosen.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> To these He also presented Himself alive after His suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over <i>a period of</i> forty days and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Gathering them together, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, <font color="red">"Which,"</font> <i>He said,</i> <font color="red">"you heard of from Me;</font>
<br><font size="-1">5</font> <font color="red">for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> So when they had come together, they were asking Him, saying, "Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?"
<br><font size="-1">7</font> He said to them, <font color="red">"It is not for you to know times or epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority;</font>
<br><font size="-1">8</font> <font color="red">but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth."</font>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="442s"></a>The Ascension</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">9</font> And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were looking on, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> And as they were gazing intently into the sky while He was going, behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> They also said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven."
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="443s"></a>The Upper Room</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day''s journey away.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> When they had entered <i>the city,</i> they went up to the upper room where they were staying; that is, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James <i>the son</i> of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas <i>the son</i> of James.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> These all with one mind were continually devoting themselves to prayer, along with <i>the</i> women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> At this time Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren (a gathering of about one hundred and twenty persons was there together), and said,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> "Brethren, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> "For he was counted among us and received his share in this ministry."
<br><font size="-1">18</font> (Now this man acquired a field with the price of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> And it became known to all who were living in Jerusalem; so that in their own language that field was called Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)
<br><font size="-1">20</font> "For it is written in the book of Psalms, <br>''L<font size="-1">ET HIS HOMESTEAD BE MADE DESOLATE</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND LET NO ONE DWELL IN IT</font>''; <br>and, <br>''L<font size="-1">ET ANOTHER MAN TAKE HIS</font> <font size="-1">OFFICE</font>.''
<br><font size="-1">21</font> "Therefore it is necessary that of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us&#151;
<br><font size="-1">22</font> beginning with the baptism of John until the day that He was taken up from us&#151;one of these <i>must</i> become a witness with us of His resurrection."
<br><font size="-1">23</font> So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was also called Justus), and Matthias.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> And they prayed and said, "You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two You have chosen
<br><font size="-1">25</font> to occupy this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place."
<br><font size="-1">26</font> And they drew lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="444s"></a>The Day of Pentecost</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one of them.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them utterance.
<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> And when this sound occurred, the crowd came together, and were bewildered because each one of them was hearing them speak in his own language.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> They were amazed and astonished, saying, "Why, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?
<br><font size="-1">8</font> "And how is it that we each hear <i>them</i> in our own language to which we were born?
<br><font size="-1">9</font> "Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Cretans and Arabs&#151;we hear them in our <i>own</i> tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God."
<br><font size="-1">12</font> And they all continued in amazement and great perplexity, saying to one another, "What does this mean?"
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But others were mocking and saying, "They are full of sweet wine."
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="445s"></a>Peter''s Sermon</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> But Peter, taking his stand with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them: "Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give heed to my words.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> "For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is <i>only</i> the third hour of the day;

<br><font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> "Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through Him in your midst, just as you yourselves know&#151;

<br><font size="-1">24</font> "But God raised Him up again, putting an end to the agony of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held in its power.

<br><font size="-1"><b>29</b></font> "Brethren, I may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> "And so, because he was a prophet and knew that G<font size="-1">OD HAD SWORN TO HIM WITH AN OATH TO SEAT</font> <i>one</i> <font size="-1">OF HIS DESCENDANTS ON HIS THRONE</font>,

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="446s"></a>The Ingathering</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>37</b></font> Now when they heard <i>this,</i> they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brethren, what shall we do?"
<br><font size="-1">38</font> Peter <i>said</i> to them, "Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
<br><font size="-1">39</font> "For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call to Himself."
<br><font size="-1">40</font> And with many other words he solemnly testified and kept on exhorting them, saying, "Be saved from this perverse generation!"
<br><font size="-1">41</font> So then, those who had received his word were baptized; and that day there were added about three thousand souls.
<br><font size="-1">42</font> They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles'' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
<br><font size="-1"><b>43</b></font> Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe; and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles.
<br><font size="-1">44</font> And all those who had believed were together and had all things in common;
<br><font size="-1">45</font> and they <i>began</i> selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all, as anyone might have need.
<br><font size="-1">46</font> Day by day continuing with one mind in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart,
<br><font size="-1">47</font> praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.

<font size="-1">1</font> Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the ninth <i>hour,</i> the hour of prayer.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> And a man who had been lame from his mother''s womb was being carried along, whom they used to set down every day at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, in order to beg alms of those who were entering the temple.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he <i>began</i> asking to receive alms.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> But Peter, along with John, fixed his gaze on him and said, "Look at us!"
<br><font size="-1">5</font> And he <i>began</i> to give them his attention, expecting to receive something from them.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But Peter said, "I do not possess silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene&#151;walk!"
<br><font size="-1">7</font> And seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> With a leap he stood upright and <i>began</i> to walk; and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> And all the people saw him walking and praising God;
<br><font size="-1">10</font> and they were taking note of him as being the one who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple to <i>beg</i> alms, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="448s"></a>Peter''s Second Sermon</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> While he was clinging to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them at the so-called portico of Solomon, full of amazement.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> But when Peter saw <i>this,</i> he replied to the people, "Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this, or why do you gaze at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk?
<br><font size="-1">13</font> "The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus, <i>the one</i> whom you delivered and disowned in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> "But you disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,
<br><font size="-1">15</font> but put to death the Prince of life, <i>the one</i> whom God raised from the dead, <i>a fact</i> to which we are witnesses.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> "And on the basis of faith in His name, <i>it is</i> the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know; and the faith which <i>comes</i> through Him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all.
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> "And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers did also.

<font size="-1">1</font> As they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple <i>guard</i> and the Sadducees came up to them,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> being greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> And they laid hands on them and put them in jail until the next day, for it was already evening.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> But many of those who had heard the message believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.
<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> On the next day, their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;
<br><font size="-1">6</font> and Annas the high priest <i>was there,</i> and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of high-priestly descent.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> When they had placed them in the center, they <i>began to</i> inquire, "By what power, or in what name, have you done this?"
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers and elders of the people,

<font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> Now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men, they were amazed, and <i>began</i> to recognize them as having been with Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> But when they had ordered them to leave the Council, they <i>began</i> to confer with one another,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> saying, "What shall we do with these men? For the fact that a noteworthy miracle has taken place through them is apparent to all who live in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> "But so that it will not spread any further among the people, let us warn them to speak no longer to any man in this name."
<br><font size="-1">18</font> And when they had summoned them, they commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> But Peter and John answered and said to them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God, you be the judge;
<br><font size="-1">20</font> for we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard."
<br><font size="-1">21</font> When they had threatened them further, they let them go (finding no basis on which to punish them) on account of the people, because they were all glorifying God for what had happened;
<br><font size="-1">22</font> for the man was more than forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been performed.
<br><font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> When they had been released, they went to their own <i>companions</i> and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> And when they heard <i>this,</i> they lifted their voices to God with one accord and said, "O Lord, it is You who <font size="-1">MADE THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND THE</font> <font size="-1">SEA</font>, <font size="-1">AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM</font>,
<br><font size="-1">25</font> who by the Holy Spirit, <i>through</i> the mouth of our father David Your servant, said, <br>''W<font size="-1">HY DID THE</font> G<font size="-1">ENTILES RAGE</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND THE PEOPLES DEVISE FUTILE THINGS</font>?

<font size="-1"><b>32</b></font> And the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul; and not one <i>of them</i> claimed that anything belonging to him was his own, but all things were common property to them.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was upon them all.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> For there was not a needy person among them, for all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales
<br><font size="-1">35</font> and lay them at the apostles'' feet, and they would be distributed to each as any had need.
<br><font size="-1"><b>36</b></font> Now Joseph, a Levite of Cyprian birth, who was also called Barnabas by the apostles (which translated means Son of Encouragement),

<br><font size="-1">3</font> But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back <i>some</i> of the price of the land?
<br><font size="-1">4</font> "While it remained <i>unsold,</i> did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not under your control? Why is it that you have conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God."
<br><font size="-1">5</font> And as he heard these words, Ananias fell down and breathed his last; and great fear came over all who heard of it.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> The young men got up and covered him up, and after carrying him out, they buried him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> Now there elapsed an interval of about three hours, and his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> And Peter responded to her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for such and such a price?" And she said, "Yes, that was the price."
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Then Peter <i>said</i> to her, "Why is it that you have agreed together to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out <i>as well.</i>"
<br><font size="-1">10</font> And immediately she fell at his feet and breathed her last, and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> And great fear came over the whole church, and over all who heard of these things.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> At the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were taking place among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon''s portico.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But none of the rest dared to associate with them; however, the people held them in high esteem.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> And all the more believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women, were constantly added to <i>their number,</i>
<br><font size="-1">15</font> to such an extent that they even carried the sick out into the streets and laid them on cots and pallets, so that when Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on any one of them.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Also the people from the cities in the vicinity of Jerusalem were coming together, bringing people who were sick or afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all being healed.

<br><font size="-1">18</font> They laid hands on the apostles and put them in a public jail.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the gates of the prison, and taking them out he said,

<br><font size="-1">21</font> Upon hearing <i>this,</i> they entered into the temple about daybreak and <i>began</i> to teach.
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> Now when the high priest and his associates came, they called the Council together, even all the Senate of the sons of Israel, and sent <i>orders</i> to the prison house for them to be brought.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> But the officers who came did not find them in the prison; and they returned and reported back,
<br><font size="-1">23</font> saying, "We found the prison house locked quite securely and the guards standing at the doors; but when we had opened up, we found no one inside."
<br><font size="-1">24</font> Now when the captain of the temple <i>guard</i> and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed about them as to what would come of this.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> But someone came and reported to them, "The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!"
<br><font size="-1">26</font> Then the captain went along with the officers and <i>proceeded</i> to bring them <i>back</i> without violence (for they were afraid of the people, that they might be stoned).
<br><font size="-1"><b>27</b></font> When they had brought them, they stood them before the Council. The high priest questioned them,
<br><font size="-1">28</font> saying, "We gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in this name, and yet, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man''s blood upon us."
<br><font size="-1">29</font> But Peter and the apostles answered, "We must obey God rather than men.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> "The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you had put to death by hanging Him on a cross.

<br><font size="-1">35</font> And he said to them, "Men of Israel, take care what you propose to do with these men.
<br><font size="-1">36</font> "For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a group of about four hundred men joined up with him. But he was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.

<br><font size="-1"><b>40</b></font> They took his advice; and after calling the apostles in, they flogged them and ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and <i>then</i> released them.

<br><font size="-1">5</font> The statement found approval with the whole congregation; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch.

<br><font size="-1">10</font> But they were unable to cope with the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Then they secretly induced men to say, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and <i>against</i> God."
<br><font size="-1">12</font> And they stirred up the people, the elders and the scribes, and they came up to him and dragged him away and brought him before the Council.

<font size="-1">1</font> Saul was in hearty agreement with putting him to death.

<br><font size="-1">3</font> But Saul <i>began</i> ravaging the church, entering house after house, and dragging off men and women, he would put them in prison.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4419s"></a>Philip in Samaria</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> Therefore, those who had been scattered went about preaching the word.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Philip went down to the city of Samaria and <i>began</i> proclaiming Christ to them.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> The crowds with one accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip, as they heard and saw the signs which he was performing.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For <i>in the case of</i> many who had unclean spirits, they were coming out <i>of them</i> shouting with a loud voice; and many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> So there was much rejoicing in that city.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> Now there was a man named Simon, who formerly was practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great;
<br><font size="-1">10</font> and they all, from smallest to greatest, were giving attention to him, saying, "This man is what is called the Great Power of God."
<br><font size="-1">11</font> And they were giving him attention because he had for a long time astonished them with his magic arts.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> But when they believed Philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, men and women alike.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Even Simon himself believed; and after being baptized, he continued on with Philip, and as he observed signs and great miracles taking place, he was constantly amazed.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John,
<br><font size="-1">15</font> who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> For He had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Then they <i>began</i> laying their hands on them, and they were receiving the Holy Spirit.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles'' hands, he offered them money,
<br><font size="-1">19</font> saying, "Give this authority to me as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."
<br><font size="-1">20</font> But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!

<br><font size="-1">22</font> "Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray the Lord that, if possible, the intention of your heart may be forgiven you.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> "For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity."

<font size="-1"><b>25</b></font> So, when they had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, and were preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.
<br><font size="-1"><b>26</b></font> But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip saying, "Get up and go south to the road that descends from Jerusalem to Gaza." (This is a desert <i>road.</i>)
<br><font size="-1">27</font> So he got up and went; and there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship,
<br><font size="-1">28</font> and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> Then the Spirit said to Philip, "Go up and join this chariot."
<br><font size="-1">30</font> Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?"
<br><font size="-1">31</font> And he said, "Well, how could I, unless someone guides me?" And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: <br>"H<font size="-1">E WAS LED AS A SHEEP TO SLAUGHTER</font>; <br>A<font size="-1">ND AS A LAMB BEFORE ITS SHEARER IS SILENT</font>, <br>S<font size="-1">O</font> H<font size="-1">E DOES NOT OPEN</font> H<font size="-1">IS MOUTH</font>.

<br><font size="-1">34</font> The eunuch answered Philip and said, "Please <i>tell me,</i> of whom does the prophet say this? Of himself or of someone else?"
<br><font size="-1">35</font> Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture he preached Jesus to him.
<br><font size="-1">36</font> As they went along the road they came to some water; and the eunuch *said, "Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?"
<br><font size="-1">37</font> [And Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may." And he answered and said, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."]
<br><font size="-1">38</font> And he ordered the chariot to stop; and they both went down into the water, Philip as well as the eunuch, and he baptized him.
<br><font size="-1">39</font> When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch no longer saw him, but went on his way rejoicing.
<br><font size="-1">40</font> But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he kept preaching the gospel to all the cities until he came to Caesarea.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4421s"></a>The Conversion of Saul</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> and asked for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> As he was traveling, it happened that he was approaching Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> and he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, <font color="red">"Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?"</font>
<br><font size="-1">5</font> And he said, "Who are You, Lord?" And He <i>said,</i> <font color="red">"I am Jesus whom you are persecuting,</font>
<br><font size="-1">6</font> <font color="red">but get up and enter the city, and it will be told you what you must do."</font>
<br><font size="-1">7</font> The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; and leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, <font color="red">"Ananias."</font> And he said, "Here I am, Lord."
<br><font size="-1">11</font> And the Lord <i>said</i> to him, <font color="red">"Get up and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying,</font>
<br><font size="-1">12</font> <font color="red">and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him, so that he might regain his sight."</font>
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he did to Your saints at Jerusalem;
<br><font size="-1">14</font> and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your name."
<br><font size="-1">15</font> But the Lord said to him, <font color="red">"Go, for he is a chosen instrument of Mine, to bear My name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel;</font>
<br><font size="-1">16</font> <font color="red">for I will show him how much he must suffer for My name''s sake."</font>
<br><font size="-1">17</font> So Ananias departed and entered the house, and after laying his hands on him said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
<br><font size="-1">18</font> And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he regained his sight, and he got up and was baptized;
<br><font size="-1">19</font> and he took food and was strengthened.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4422s"></a>Saul Begins to Preach Christ</i></b></font></p>

<b><font size="-1"></font></b> Now for several days he was with the disciples who were at Damascus,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> and immediately he <i>began</i> to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, "He is the Son of God."
<br><font size="-1">21</font> All those hearing him continued to be amazed, and were saying, "Is this not he who in Jerusalem destroyed those who called on this name, and <i>who</i> had come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests?"
<br><font size="-1">22</font> But Saul kept increasing in strength and confounding the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this <i>Jesus</i> is the Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> When many days had elapsed, the Jews plotted together to do away with him,
<br><font size="-1">24</font> but their plot became known to Saul. They were also watching the gates day and night so that they might put him to death;
<br><font size="-1">25</font> but his disciples took him by night and let him down through <i>an opening in</i> the wall, lowering him in a large basket.
<br><font size="-1"><b>26</b></font> When he came to Jerusalem, he was trying to associate with the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the apostles and described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had talked to him, and how at Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> And he was with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic <i>Jews;</i> but they were attempting to put him to death.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> But when the brethren learned <i>of it,</i> they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.
<br><font size="-1"><b>31</b></font> So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4423s"></a>Peter''s Ministry</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>32</b></font> Now as Peter was traveling through all <i>those regions,</i> he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years, for he was paralyzed.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; get up and make your bed." Immediately he got up.
<br><font size="-1">35</font> And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
<br><font size="-1"><b>36</b></font> Now in Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which translated <i>in Greek</i> is called Dorcas); this woman was abounding with deeds of kindness and charity which she continually did.
<br><font size="-1">37</font> And it happened at that time that she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her body, they laid it in an upper room.
<br><font size="-1">38</font> Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him, "Do not delay in coming to us."
<br><font size="-1">39</font> So Peter arose and went with them. When he arrived, they brought him into the upper room; and all the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing all the tunics and garments that Dorcas used to make while she was with them.
<br><font size="-1">40</font> But Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed, and turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, arise." And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
<br><font size="-1">41</font> And he gave her his hand and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.
<br><font size="-1">42</font> It became known all over Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">43</font> And Peter stayed many days in Joppa with a tanner <i>named</i> Simon.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4410"></a>ACTS: CHAPTER 10&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4424s"></a>Cornelius''s Vision</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now <i>there was</i> a man at Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian cohort,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> a devout man and one who feared God with all his household, and gave many alms to the <i>Jewish</i> people and prayed to God continually.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God who had <i>just</i> come in and said to him, "Cornelius!"
<br><font size="-1">4</font> And fixing his gaze on him and being much alarmed, he said, "What is it, Lord?" And he said to him, "Your prayers and alms have ascended as a memorial before God.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> "Now dispatch <i>some</i> men to Joppa and send for a man <i>named</i> Simon, who is also called Peter;
<br><font size="-1">6</font> he is staying with a tanner <i>named</i> Simon, whose house is by the sea."
<br><font size="-1">7</font> When the angel who was speaking to him had left, he summoned two of his servants and a devout soldier of those who were his personal attendants,
<br><font size="-1">8</font> and after he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> On the next day, as they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> But he became hungry and was desiring to eat; but while they were making preparations, he fell into a trance;
<br><font size="-1">11</font> and he *saw the sky opened up, and an object like a great sheet coming down, lowered by four corners to the ground,
<br><font size="-1">12</font> and there were in it all <i>kinds of</i> four-footed animals and crawling creatures of the earth and birds of the air.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> A voice came to him, "Get up, Peter, kill and eat!"
<br><font size="-1">14</font> But Peter said, "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything unholy and unclean."
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Again a voice <i>came</i> to him a second time, "What God has cleansed, no <i>longer</i> consider unholy."
<br><font size="-1">16</font> This happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into the sky.
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> Now while Peter was greatly perplexed in mind as to what the vision which he had seen might be, behold, the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having asked directions for Simon''s house, appeared at the gate;
<br><font size="-1">18</font> and calling out, they were asking whether Simon, who was also called Peter, was staying there.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> While Peter was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men are looking for you.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> "But get up, go downstairs and accompany them without misgivings, for I have sent them Myself."
<br><font size="-1">21</font> Peter went down to the men and said, "Behold, I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for which you have come?"
<br><font size="-1">22</font> They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man well spoken of by the entire nation of the Jews, was <i>divinely</i> directed by a holy angel to send for you <i>to come</i> to his house and hear a message from you."
<br><font size="-1">23</font> So he invited them in and gave them lodging.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4425s"></a>Peter at Caesarea</i></b></font></p>

<b><font size="-1"></font></b> And on the next day he got up and went away with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> On the following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell at his feet and worshiped <i>him.</i>
<br><font size="-1">26</font> But Peter raised him up, saying, "Stand up; I too am <i>just</i> a man."
<br><font size="-1">27</font> As he talked with him, he entered and *found many people assembled.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> And he said to them, "You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a man who is a Jew to associate with a foreigner or to visit him; and <i>yet</i> God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> "That is why I came without even raising any objection when I was sent for. So I ask for what reason you have sent for me."
<br><font size="-1"><b>30</b></font> Cornelius said, "Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the ninth hour; and behold, a man stood before me in shining garments,
<br><font size="-1">31</font> and he *said, ''Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> ''Therefore send to Joppa and invite Simon, who is also called Peter, to come to you; he is staying at the house of Simon <i>the</i> tanner by the sea.''
<br><font size="-1">33</font> "So I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now then, we are all here present before God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord."
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4426s"></a>Gentiles Hear Good News</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>34</b></font> Opening his mouth, Peter said:
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> "I most certainly understand <i>now</i> that God is not one to show partiality,
<br><font size="-1">35</font> but in every nation the man who fears Him and does what is right is welcome to Him.
<br><font size="-1">36</font> "The word which He sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all)&#151;
<br><font size="-1">37</font> you yourselves know the thing which took place throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed.
<br><font size="-1">38</font> "<i>You know of</i> Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and <i>how</i> He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.
<br><font size="-1">39</font> "We are witnesses of all the things He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They also put Him to death by hanging Him on a cross.
<br><font size="-1">40</font> "God raised Him up on the third day and granted that He become visible,
<br><font size="-1">41</font> not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God, <i>that is,</i> to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead.
<br><font size="-1">42</font> "And He ordered us to preach to the people, and solemnly to testify that this is the One who has been appointed by God as Judge of the living and the dead.
<br><font size="-1">43</font> "Of Him all the prophets bear witness that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins."
<br><font size="-1"><b>44</b></font> While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message.
<br><font size="-1">45</font> All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also.
<br><font size="-1">46</font> For they were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God. Then Peter answered,
<br><font size="-1">47</font> "Surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we <i>did,</i> can he?"
<br><font size="-1">48</font> And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.

<font size="-1">1</font> Now the apostles and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those who were circumcised took issue with him,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> saying, "You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them."
<br><font size="-1">4</font> But Peter began <i>speaking</i> and <i>proceeded</i> to explain to them in orderly sequence, saying,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> "I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object coming down like a great sheet lowered by four corners from the sky; and it came right down to me,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> and when I had fixed my gaze on it and was observing it I saw the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the crawling creatures and the birds of the air.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> "I also heard a voice saying to me, ''Get up, Peter; kill and eat.''
<br><font size="-1">8</font> "But I said, ''By no means, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered my mouth.''

<br><font size="-1">11</font> "And behold, at that moment three men appeared at the house in which we were <i>staying,</i> having been sent to me from Caesarea.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> "The Spirit told me to go with them without misgivings. These six brethren also went with me and we entered the man''s house.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> "And he reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, ''Send to Joppa and have Simon, who is also called Peter, brought here;

<br><font size="-1">15</font> "And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as <i>He did</i> upon us at the beginning.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> "And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, <font color="red">''John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.''</font>
<br><font size="-1">17</font> "Therefore if God gave to them the same gift as <i>He gave</i> to us also after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God''s way?"
<br><font size="-1">18</font> When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified God, saying, "Well then, God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance <i>that leads</i> to life."
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4428s"></a>The Church at Antioch</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> So then those who were scattered because of the persecution that occurred in connection with Stephen made their way to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews alone.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and <i>began</i> speaking to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> The news about them reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas off to Antioch.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> Then when he arrived and witnessed the grace of God, he rejoiced and <i>began</i> to encourage them all with resolute heart to remain <i>true</i> to the Lord;
<br><font size="-1">24</font> for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And considerable numbers were brought to the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> And he left for Tarsus to look for Saul;
<br><font size="-1">26</font> and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And for an entire year they met with the church and taught considerable numbers; and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
<br><font size="-1"><b>27</b></font> Now at this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> One of them named Agabus stood up and <i>began</i> to indicate by the Spirit that there would certainly be a great famine all over the world. And this took place in the <i>reign</i> of Claudius.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> And in the proportion that any of the disciples had means, each of them determined to send <i>a contribution</i> for the relief of the brethren living in Judea.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> And this they did, sending it in charge of Barnabas and Saul to the elders.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4429s"></a>Peter''s Arrest and Deliverance</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church in order to mistreat them.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> And he had James the brother of John put to death with a sword.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. Now it was during the days of Unleavened Bread.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> When he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out before the people.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> So Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer for him was being made fervently by the church to God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> On the very night when Herod was about to bring him forward, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards in front of the door were watching over the prison.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> And behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter''s side and woke him up, saying, "Get up quickly." And his chains fell off his hands.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> And the angel said to him, "Gird yourself and put on your sandals." And he did so. And he *said to him, "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me."
<br><font size="-1">9</font> And he went out and continued to follow, and he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> When they had passed the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened for them by itself; and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> When Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent forth His angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting."
<br><font size="-1">12</font> And when he realized <i>this,</i> he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> When he knocked at the door of the gate, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> When she recognized Peter''s voice, because of her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> They said to her, "You are out of your mind!" But she kept insisting that it was so. They kept saying, "It is his angel."
<br><font size="-1">16</font> But Peter continued knocking; and when they had opened <i>the door,</i> they saw him and were amazed.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison. And he said, "Report these things to James and the brethren." Then he left and went to another place.
<br><font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> Now when day came, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers <i>as to</i> what could have become of Peter.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> When Herod had searched for him and had not found him, he examined the guards and ordered that they be led away <i>to execution.</i> Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and was spending time there.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4430s"></a>Death of Herod</i></b></font></p>

<br><font size="-1">21</font> On an appointed day Herod, having put on his royal apparel, took his seat on the rostrum and <i>began</i> delivering an address to them.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> The people kept crying out, "The voice of a god and not of a man!"
<br><font size="-1">23</font> And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died.
<br><font size="-1"><b>24</b></font> But the word of the Lord continued to grow and to be multiplied.

<font size="-1">1</font> Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was <i>there,</i> prophets and teachers: Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> While they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> When they reached Salamis, they <i>began</i> to proclaim the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they also had John as their helper.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a magician, a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar-Jesus,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> But Elymas the magician (for so his name is translated) was opposing them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> But Saul, who was also <i>known as</i> Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fixed his gaze on him,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> and said, "You who are full of all deceit and fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to make crooked the straight ways of the Lord?
<br><font size="-1">11</font> "Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and not see the sun for a time." And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking those who would lead him by the hand.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Then the proconsul believed when he saw what had happened, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John left them and returned to Jerusalem.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> But going on from Perga, they arrived at Pisidian Antioch, and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> After the reading of the Law and the Prophets the synagogue officials sent to them, saying, "Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it."
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said,
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> "Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen:
<br><font size="-1">17</font> "The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He led them out from it.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> "For a period of about forty years He put up with them in the wilderness.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> "When He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land as an inheritance&#151;<i>all of which took</i> about four hundred and fifty years.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> "After these things He gave <i>them</i> judges until Samuel the prophet.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> "Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> "After He had removed him, He raised up David to be their king, concerning whom He also testified and said, ''I <font size="-1">HAVE FOUND</font> D<font size="-1">AVID</font> the son of Jesse, <font size="-1">A</font> <font size="-1">MAN AFTER</font> M<font size="-1">Y HEART</font>, who will do all My will.''
<br><font size="-1">23</font> "From the descendants of this man, according to promise, God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus,
<br><font size="-1">24</font> after John had proclaimed before His coming a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> "And while John was completing his course, he kept saying, ''What do you suppose that I am? I am not <i>He.</i> But behold, one is coming after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.''
<br><font size="-1"><b>26</b></font> "Brethren, sons of Abraham''s family, and those among you who fear God, to us the message of this salvation has been sent.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> "For those who live in Jerusalem, and their rulers, recognizing neither Him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled <i>these</i> by condemning <i>Him.</i>
<br><font size="-1">28</font> "And though they found no ground for <i>putting Him to</i> death, they asked Pilate that He be executed.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> "When they had carried out all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the cross and laid Him in a tomb.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> "But God raised Him from the dead;
<br><font size="-1">31</font> and for many days He appeared to those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, the very ones who are now His witnesses to the people.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> "And we preach to you the good news of the promise made to the fathers,
<br><font size="-1">33</font> that God has fulfilled this <i>promise</i> to our children in that He raised up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, ''Y<font size="-1">OU ARE</font> M<font size="-1">Y</font> S<font size="-1">ON</font>; <font size="-1">TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN</font> Y<font size="-1">OU</font>.''
<br><font size="-1">34</font> "<i>As for the fact</i> that He raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to decay, He has spoken in this way: ''I <font size="-1">WILL GIVE YOU THE HOLY</font> <i>and</i> <font size="-1">SURE</font> <i>blessings</i> <font size="-1">OF</font> D<font size="-1">AVID</font>.''
<br><font size="-1">35</font> "Therefore He also says in another <i>Psalm,</i> ''Y<font size="-1">OU WILL NOT</font> <font size="-1">ALLOW</font> Y<font size="-1">OUR</font> H<font size="-1">OLY</font> O<font size="-1">NE TO</font> <font size="-1">UNDERGO DECAY</font>.''
<br><font size="-1">36</font> "For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and was laid among his fathers and underwent decay;
<br><font size="-1">37</font> but He whom God raised did not undergo decay.
<br><font size="-1">38</font> "Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,
<br><font size="-1">39</font> and through Him everyone who believes is freed from all things, from which you could not be freed through the Law of Moses.
<br><font size="-1">40</font> "Therefore take heed, so that the thing spoken of in the Prophets may not come upon <i>you:</i>
<br><font size="-1">41</font> ''B<font size="-1">EHOLD</font>, <font size="-1">YOU SCOFFERS</font>, <font size="-1">AND MARVEL</font>, <font size="-1">AND</font> <font size="-1">PERISH</font>; <br>F<font size="-1">OR</font> I <font size="-1">AM ACCOMPLISHING A WORK IN YOUR DAYS</font>, <br>A <font size="-1">WORK WHICH YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE</font>, <font size="-1">THOUGH SOMEONE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU</font>.''&nbsp;"
<br><font size="-1"><b>42</b></font> As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people kept begging that these things might be spoken to them the next Sabbath.
<br><font size="-1">43</font> Now when <i>the meeting of</i> the synagogue had broken up, many of the Jews and of the God-fearing proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, were urging them to continue in the grace of God.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4432s"></a>Paul Turns to the Gentiles</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>44</b></font> The next Sabbath nearly the whole city assembled to hear the word of the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">45</font> But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and <i>began</i> contradicting the things spoken by Paul, and were blaspheming.
<br><font size="-1">46</font> Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, "It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first; since you repudiate it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.
<br><font size="-1">47</font> "For so the Lord has commanded us, <br>''I <font size="-1">HAVE PLACED</font> Y<font size="-1">OU AS A</font> <font size="-1">LIGHT FOR THE</font> G<font size="-1">ENTILES</font>, <br>T<font size="-1">HAT</font> Y<font size="-1">OU MAY</font> <font size="-1">BRING SALVATION TO THE END OF THE EARTH</font>.''&nbsp;"
<br><font size="-1"><b>48</b></font> When the Gentiles heard this, they <i>began</i> rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord; and as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed.
<br><font size="-1">49</font> And the word of the Lord was being spread through the whole region.
<br><font size="-1">50</font> But the Jews incited the devout women of prominence and the leading men of the city, and instigated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district.
<br><font size="-1">51</font> But they shook off the dust of their feet <i>in protest</i> against them and went to Iconium.
<br><font size="-1">52</font> And the disciples were continually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4414"></a>ACTS: CHAPTER 14&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4433s"></a>Acceptance and Opposition</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> In Iconium they entered the synagogue of the Jews together, and spoke in such a manner that a large number of people believed, both of Jews and of Greeks.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> But the Jews who disbelieved stirred up the minds of the Gentiles and embittered them against the brethren.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Therefore they spent a long time <i>there</i> speaking boldly <i>with reliance</i> upon the Lord, who was testifying to the word of His grace, granting that signs and wonders be done by their hands.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> But the people of the city were divided; and some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> And when an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers, to mistreat and to stone them,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> and there they continued to preach the gospel.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> At Lystra a man was sitting who had no strength in his feet, lame from his mother''s womb, who had never walked.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> This man was listening to Paul as he spoke, who, when he had fixed his gaze on him and had seen that he had faith to be made well,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> said with a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet." And he leaped up and <i>began</i> to walk.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voice, saying in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have become like men and have come down to us."
<br><font size="-1">12</font> And they <i>began</i> calling Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> The priest of Zeus, whose <i>temple</i> was just outside the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd, crying out
<br><font size="-1">15</font> and saying, "Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men of the same nature as you, and preach the gospel to you that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, <font size="-1">WHO MADE THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM</font>.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> "In the generations gone by He permitted all the nations to go their own ways;
<br><font size="-1">17</font> and yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness."
<br><font size="-1">18</font> <i>Even</i> saying these things, with difficulty they restrained the crowds from offering sacrifice to them.
<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having won over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> But while the disciples stood around him, he got up and entered the city. The next day he went away with Barnabas to Derbe.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> After they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,
<br><font size="-1">22</font> strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and <i>saying,</i> "Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God."
<br><font size="-1">23</font> When they had appointed elders for them in every church, having prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
<br><font size="-1"><b>24</b></font> They passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> From there they sailed to Antioch, from which they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had accomplished.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> When they had arrived and gathered the church together, they <i>began</i> to report all things that God had done with them and how He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> And they spent a long time with the disciples.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4415"></a>ACTS: CHAPTER 15&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4434s"></a>The Council at Jerusalem</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Some men came down from Judea and <i>began</i> teaching the brethren, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."
<br><font size="-1">2</font> And when Paul and Barnabas had great dissension and debate with them, <i>the brethren</i> determined that Paul and Barnabas and some others of them should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders concerning this issue.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Therefore, being sent on their way by the church, they were passing through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and were bringing great joy to all the brethren.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> When they arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> But some of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed stood up, saying, "It is necessary to circumcise them and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses."
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> The apostles and the elders came together to look into this matter.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, "Brethren, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> "And God, who knows the heart, testified to them giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He also did to us;
<br><font size="-1">9</font> and He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> "Now therefore why do you put God to the test by placing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?
<br><font size="-1">11</font> "But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they also are."
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> All the people kept silent, and they were listening to Barnabas and Paul as they were relating what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4435s"></a>James''s Judgment</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">13</font> After they had stopped speaking, James answered, saying, "Brethren, listen to me.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> "Simeon has related how God first concerned Himself about taking from among the Gentiles a people for His name.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> "With this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> ''A<font size="-1">FTER THESE THINGS</font> I will return, <br>A<font size="-1">ND</font> I <font size="-1">WILL REBUILD THE</font> <font size="-1">TABERNACLE OF</font> D<font size="-1">AVID WHICH HAS FALLEN</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND</font> I <font size="-1">WILL REBUILD ITS RUINS</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND</font> I <font size="-1">WILL RESTORE IT</font>,
<br><font size="-1">17</font> S<font size="-1">O THAT THE REST OF</font> <font size="-1">MANKIND MAY SEEK THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND ALL THE</font> G<font size="-1">ENTILES</font> <font size="-1">WHO ARE CALLED BY</font> M<font size="-1">Y NAME</font>,''
<br><font size="-1">18</font> S<font size="-1">AYS THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD</font>, <font size="-1">WHO</font> <font size="-1">MAKES THESE THINGS KNOWN FROM LONG AGO</font>.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> "Therefore it is my judgment that we do not trouble those who are turning to God from among the Gentiles,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> but that we write to them that they abstain from things contaminated by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> "For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who preach him, since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath."
<br><font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas&#151;Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren,
<br><font size="-1">23</font> and they sent this letter by them, "The apostles and the brethren who are elders, to the brethren in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are from the Gentiles, greetings.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> "Since we have heard that some of our number to whom we gave no instruction have disturbed you with <i>their</i> words, unsettling your souls,
<br><font size="-1">25</font> it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to select men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
<br><font size="-1">26</font> men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> "Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will also report the same things by word <i>of mouth.</i>
<br><font size="-1">28</font> "For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials:
<br><font size="-1">29</font> that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication; if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well. Farewell."
<br><font size="-1"><b>30</b></font> So when they were sent away, they went down to Antioch; and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> When they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brethren with a lengthy message.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> After they had spent time <i>there,</i> they were sent away from the brethren in peace to those who had sent them out.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> [But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.]
<br><font size="-1">35</font> But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching with many others also, the word of the Lord.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4436s"></a>Second Missionary Journey</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>36</b></font> After some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return and visit the brethren in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, <i>and see</i> how they are."
<br><font size="-1">37</font> Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them also.
<br><font size="-1">38</font> But Paul kept insisting that they should not take him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work.
<br><font size="-1">39</font> And there occurred such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.
<br><font size="-1">40</font> But Paul chose Silas and left, being committed by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">41</font> And he was traveling through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4416"></a>ACTS: CHAPTER 16&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4437s"></a>The Macedonian Vision</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. And a disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> and he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Paul wanted this man to go with him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Now while they were passing through the cities, they were delivering the decrees which had been decided upon by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem, for them to observe.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> So the churches were being strengthened in the faith, and were increasing in number daily.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> They passed through the Phrygian and Galatian region, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> and after they came to Mysia, they were trying to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> A vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing and appealing to him, and saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us."
<br><font size="-1">10</font> When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> So putting out to sea from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the day following to Neapolis;
<br><font size="-1">12</font> and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia, a <i>Roman</i> colony; and we were staying in this city for some days.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to a riverside, where we were supposing that there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had assembled.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4438s"></a>First Convert in Europe</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">14</font> A woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics, a worshiper of God, was listening; and the Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> And when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay." And she prevailed upon us.
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a slave-girl having a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing her masters much profit by fortune-telling.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Following after Paul and us, she kept crying out, saying, "These men are bond-servants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation."
<br><font size="-1">18</font> She continued doing this for many days. But Paul was greatly annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!" And it came out at that very moment.
<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market place before the authorities,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> and when they had brought them to the chief magistrates, they said, "These men are throwing our city into confusion, being Jews,
<br><font size="-1">21</font> and are proclaiming customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans."
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4439s"></a>Paul and Silas Imprisoned</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">22</font> The crowd rose up together against them, and the chief magistrates tore their robes off them and proceeded to order <i>them</i> to be beaten with rods.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> When they had struck them with many blows, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely;
<br><font size="-1">24</font> and he, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
<br><font size="-1"><b>25</b></font> But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them;
<br><font size="-1">26</font> and suddenly there came a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison house were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone''s chains were unfastened.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> When the jailer awoke and saw the prison doors opened, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> But Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!"
<br><font size="-1">29</font> And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas,
<br><font size="-1">30</font> and after he brought them out, he said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4440s"></a>The Jailer Converted</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">31</font> They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household."
<br><font size="-1">32</font> And they spoke the word of the Lord to him together with all who were in his house.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> And he took them that <i>very</i> hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he was baptized, he and all his <i>household.</i>
<br><font size="-1">34</font> And he brought them into his house and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, having believed in God with his whole household.
<br><font size="-1"><b>35</b></font> Now when day came, the chief magistrates sent their policemen, saying, "Release those men."
<br><font size="-1">36</font> And the jailer reported these words to Paul, <i>saying,</i> "The chief magistrates have sent to release you. Therefore come out now and go in peace."
<br><font size="-1">37</font> But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us in public without trial, men who are Romans, and have thrown us into prison; and now are they sending us away secretly? No indeed! But let them come themselves and bring us out."
<br><font size="-1">38</font> The policemen reported these words to the chief magistrates. They were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,
<br><font size="-1">39</font> and they came and appealed to them, and when they had brought them out, they kept begging them to leave the city.
<br><font size="-1">40</font> They went out of the prison and entered <i>the house of</i> Lydia, and when they saw the brethren, they encouraged them and departed.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4441s"></a>Paul at Thessalonica</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now when they had traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> And according to Paul''s custom, he went to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> explaining and giving evidence that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and <i>saying,</i> "This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ."
<br><font size="-1">4</font> And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with a large number of the God-fearing Greeks and a number of the leading women.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> But the Jews, becoming jealous and taking along some wicked men from the market place, formed a mob and set the city in an uproar; and attacking the house of Jason, they were seeking to bring them out to the people.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> When they did not find them, they <i>began</i> dragging Jason and some brethren before the city authorities, shouting, "These men who have upset the world have come here also;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> and Jason has welcomed them, and they all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus."
<br><font size="-1">8</font> They stirred up the crowd and the city authorities who heard these things.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> And when they had received a pledge from Jason and the others, they released them.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4442s"></a>Paul at Berea</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily <i>to see</i> whether these things were so.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Therefore many of them believed, along with a number of prominent Greek women and men.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But when the Jews of Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there as well, agitating and stirring up the crowds.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Then immediately the brethren sent Paul out to go as far as the sea; and Silas and Timothy remained there.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Now those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4443s"></a>Paul at Athens</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was being provoked within him as he was observing the city full of idols.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> So he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing <i>Gentiles,</i> and in the market place every day with those who happened to be present.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> And also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him. Some were saying, "What would this idle babbler wish to say?" Others, "He seems to be a proclaimer of strange deities,"&#151;because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is which you are proclaiming?
<br><font size="-1">20</font> "For you are bringing some strange things to our ears; so we want to know what these things mean."
<br><font size="-1">21</font> (Now all the Athenians and the strangers visiting there used to spend their time in nothing other than telling or hearing something new.)
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4444s"></a>Sermon on Mars Hill</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, "Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> "For while I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship, I also found an altar with this inscription, ''TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.'' Therefore what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> "The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;
<br><font size="-1">25</font> nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all <i>people</i> life and breath and all things;
<br><font size="-1">26</font> and He made from one <i>man</i> every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined <i>their</i> appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation,
<br><font size="-1">27</font> that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;
<br><font size="-1">28</font> for in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, ''For we also are His children.''
<br><font size="-1">29</font> "Being then the children of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and thought of man.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> "Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all <i>people</i> everywhere should repent,
<br><font size="-1">31</font> because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead."
<br><font size="-1"><b>32</b></font> Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some <i>began</i> to sneer, but others said, "We shall hear you again concerning this."
<br><font size="-1">33</font> So Paul went out of their midst.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4418"></a>ACTS: CHAPTER 18&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4445s"></a>Paul at Corinth</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> After these things he left Athens and went to Corinth.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. He came to them,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> and because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and they were working, for by trade they were tent-makers.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> And he was reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.
<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul <i>began</i> devoting himself completely to the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But when they resisted and blasphemed, he shook out his garments and said to them, "Your blood <i>be</i> on your own heads! I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Then he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next to the synagogue.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his household, and many of the Corinthians when they heard were believing and being baptized.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, <font color="red">"Do not be afraid <i>any longer,</i> but go on speaking and do not be silent;</font>
<br><font size="-1">10</font> <font color="red">for I am with you, and no man will attack you in order to harm you, for I have many people in this city."</font>
<br><font size="-1">11</font> And he settled <i>there</i> a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> saying, "This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law."
<br><font size="-1">14</font> But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it were a matter of wrong or of vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to put up with you;
<br><font size="-1">15</font> but if there are questions about words and names and your own law, look after it yourselves; I am unwilling to be a judge of these matters."
<br><font size="-1">16</font> And he drove them away from the judgment seat.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> And they all took hold of Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and <i>began</i> beating him in front of the judgment seat. But Gallio was not concerned about any of these things.
<br><font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> Paul, having remained many days longer, took leave of the brethren and put out to sea for Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchrea he had his hair cut, for he was keeping a vow.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> They came to Ephesus, and he left them there. Now he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> When they asked him to stay for a longer time, he did not consent,
<br><font size="-1">21</font> but taking leave of them and saying, "I will return to you again if God wills," he set sail from Ephesus.
<br><font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4446s"></a>Third Missionary Journey</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">23</font> And having spent some time <i>there,</i> he left and passed successively through the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
<br><font size="-1"><b>24</b></font> Now a Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the Scriptures.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus, being acquainted only with the baptism of John;
<br><font size="-1">26</font> and he began to speak out boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> And when he wanted to go across to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him; and when he had arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace,
<br><font size="-1">28</font> for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4419"></a>ACTS: CHAPTER 19&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4447s"></a>Paul at Ephesus</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> It happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus, and found some disciples.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> He said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" And they <i>said</i> to him, "No, we have not even heard whether there is a Holy Spirit."
<br><font size="-1">3</font> And he said, "Into what then were you baptized?" And they said, "Into John''s baptism."
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus."
<br><font size="-1">5</font> When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they <i>began</i> speaking with tongues and prophesying.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> There were in all about twelve men.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> And he entered the synagogue and continued speaking out boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading <i>them</i> about the kingdom of God.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the people, he withdrew from them and took away the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> This took place for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4448s"></a>Miracles at Ephesus</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,
<br><font size="-1">12</font> so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But also some of the Jewish exorcists, who went from place to place, attempted to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches."
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> And the evil spirit answered and said to them, "I recognize Jesus, and I know about Paul, but who are you?"
<br><font size="-1">16</font> And the man, in whom was the evil spirit, leaped on them and subdued all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Many also of those who had believed kept coming, confessing and disclosing their practices.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> And many of those who practiced magic brought their books together and <i>began</i> burning them in the sight of everyone; and they counted up the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> So the word of the Lord was growing mightily and prevailing.
<br><font size="-1"><b>21</b></font> Now after these things were finished, Paul purposed in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
<br><font size="-1">22</font> And having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
<br><font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> About that time there occurred no small disturbance concerning the Way.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing no little business to the craftsmen;
<br><font size="-1">25</font> these he gathered together with the workmen of similar <i>trades,</i> and said, "Men, you know that our prosperity depends upon this business.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> "You see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that gods made with hands are no gods <i>at all.</i>
<br><font size="-1">27</font> "Not only is there danger that this trade of ours fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be regarded as worthless and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship will even be dethroned from her magnificence."
<br><font size="-1"><b>28</b></font> When they heard <i>this</i> and were filled with rage, they <i>began</i> crying out, saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
<br><font size="-1">29</font> The city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul''s traveling companions from Macedonia.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> And when Paul wanted to go into the assembly, the disciples would not let him.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> Also some of the Asiarchs who were friends of his sent to him and repeatedly urged him not to venture into the theater.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> So then, some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion and the majority did not know for what reason they had come together.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> Some of the crowd concluded <i>it was</i> Alexander, since the Jews had put him forward; and having motioned with his hand, Alexander was intending to make a defense to the assembly.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> But when they recognized that he was a Jew, a <i>single</i> outcry arose from them all as they shouted for about two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
<br><font size="-1">35</font> After quieting the crowd, the town clerk *said, "Men of Ephesus, what man is there after all who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the <i>image</i> which fell down from heaven?
<br><font size="-1">36</font> "So, since these are undeniable facts, you ought to keep calm and to do nothing rash.
<br><font size="-1">37</font> "For you have brought these men <i>here</i> who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.
<br><font size="-1">38</font> "So then, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against any man, the courts are in session and proconsuls are <i>available;</i> let them bring charges against one another.
<br><font size="-1">39</font> "But if you want anything beyond this, it shall be settled in the lawful assembly.
<br><font size="-1">40</font> "For indeed we are in danger of being accused of a riot in connection with today''s events, since there is no <i>real</i> cause <i>for it,</i> and in this connection we will be unable to account for this disorderly gathering."
<br><font size="-1">41</font> After saying this he dismissed the assembly.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4420"></a>ACTS: CHAPTER 20&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4449s"></a>Paul in Macedonia and Greece</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and when he had exhorted them and taken his leave of them, he left to go to Macedonia.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> When he had gone through those districts and had given them much exhortation, he came to Greece.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> And <i>there</i> he spent three months, and when a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> And he was accompanied by Sopater of Berea, <i>the son</i> of Pyrrhus, and by Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> But these had gone on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> We sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas within five days; and there we stayed seven days.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul <i>began</i> talking to them, intending to leave the next day, and he prolonged his message until midnight.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting on the window sill, sinking into a deep sleep; and as Paul kept on talking, he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> But Paul went down and fell upon him, and after embracing him, he said, "Do not be troubled, for his life is in him."
<br><font size="-1">11</font> When he had gone <i>back</i> up and had broken the bread and eaten, he talked with them a long while until daybreak, and then left.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> They took away the boy alive, and were greatly comforted.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4450s"></a>Troas to Miletus</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> But we, going ahead to the ship, set sail for Assos, intending from there to take Paul on board; for so he had arranged it, intending himself to go by land.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Sailing from there, we arrived the following day opposite Chios; and the next day we crossed over to Samos; and the day following we came to Miletus.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he would not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4451s"></a>Farewell to Ephesus</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> And when they had come to him, he said to them,
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you the whole time,
<br><font size="-1">19</font> serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;
<br><font size="-1">20</font> how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly and from house to house,
<br><font size="-1">21</font> solemnly testifying to both Jews and Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> "And now, behold, bound by the Spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,
<br><font size="-1">23</font> except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> "But I do not consider my life of any account as dear to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify solemnly of the gospel of the grace of God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>25</b></font> "And now, behold, I know that all of you, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will no longer see my face.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> "Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> "For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of God.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> "Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> "I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;
<br><font size="-1">30</font> and from among your own selves men will arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> "Therefore be on the alert, remembering that night and day for a period of three years I did not cease to admonish each one with tears.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> "And now I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build <i>you</i> up and to give <i>you</i> the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> "I have coveted no one''s silver or gold or clothes.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> "You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my <i>own</i> needs and to the men who were with me.
<br><font size="-1">35</font> "In everything I showed you that by working hard in this manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, <font color="red">''It is more blessed to give than to receive.''</font>"
<br><font size="-1"><b>36</b></font> When he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.
<br><font size="-1">37</font> And they <i>began</i> to weep aloud and embraced Paul, and repeatedly kissed him,
<br><font size="-1">38</font> grieving especially over the word which he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they were accompanying him to the ship.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4452s"></a>Paul Sails from Miletus</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> When we had parted from them and had set sail, we ran a straight course to Cos and the next day to Rhodes and from there to Patara;
<br><font size="-1">2</font> and having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> When we came in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left, we kept sailing to Syria and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its cargo.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> After looking up the disciples, we stayed there seven days; and they kept telling Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> When our days there were ended, we left and started on our journey, while they all, with wives and children, escorted us until <i>we were</i> out of the city. After kneeling down on the beach and praying, we said farewell to one another.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home again.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and after greeting the brethren, we stayed with them for a day.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and entering the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we stayed with him.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Now this man had four virgin daughters who were prophetesses.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> As we were staying there for some days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> And coming to us, he took Paul''s belt and bound his own feet and hands, and said, "This is what the Holy Spirit says: ''In this way the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.''&nbsp;"
<br><font size="-1">12</font> When we had heard this, we as well as the local residents <i>began</i> begging him not to go up to Jerusalem.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
<br><font size="-1">14</font> And since he would not be persuaded, we fell silent, remarking, "The will of the Lord be done!"
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4453s"></a>Paul at Jerusalem</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> After these days we got ready and started on our way up to Jerusalem.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> <i>Some</i> of the disciples from Caesarea also came with us, taking us to Mnason of Cyprus, a disciple of long standing with whom we were to lodge.
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> After we arrived in Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> And the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> After he had greeted them, he <i>began</i> to relate one by one the things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> And when they heard it they <i>began</i> glorifying God; and they said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the Law;
<br><font size="-1">21</font> and they have been told about you, that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> "What, then, is <i>to be done?</i> They will certainly hear that you have come.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> "Therefore do this that we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow;
<br><font size="-1">24</font> take them and purify yourself along with them, and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads; and all will know that there is nothing to the things which they have been told about you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the Law.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> "But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we wrote, having decided that they should abstain from meat sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication."
<br><font size="-1">26</font> Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purifying himself along with them, went into the temple giving notice of the completion of the days of purification, until the sacrifice was offered for each one of them.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4454s"></a>Paul Seized in the Temple</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>27</b></font> When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, upon seeing him in the temple, <i>began</i> to stir up all the crowd and laid hands on him,
<br><font size="-1">28</font> crying out, "Men of Israel, come to our aid! This is the man who preaches to all men everywhere against our people and the Law and this place; and besides he has even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place."
<br><font size="-1">29</font> For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> Then all the city was provoked, and the people rushed together, and taking hold of Paul they dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> While they were seeking to kill him, a report came up to the commander of the <i>Roman</i> cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> At once he took along <i>some</i> soldiers and centurions and ran down to them; and when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> Then the commander came up and took hold of him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains; and he <i>began</i> asking who he was and what he had done.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> But among the crowd some were shouting one thing <i>and</i> some another, and when he could not find out the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.
<br><font size="-1">35</font> When he got to the stairs, he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob;
<br><font size="-1">36</font> for the multitude of the people kept following them, shouting, "Away with him!"
<br><font size="-1"><b>37</b></font> As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commander, "May I say something to you?" And he *said, "Do you know Greek?
<br><font size="-1">38</font> "Then you are not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?"
<br><font size="-1">39</font> But Paul said, "I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city; and I beg you, allow me to speak to the people."
<br><font size="-1">40</font> When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, motioned to the people with his hand; and when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, saying,
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4422"></a>ACTS: CHAPTER 22&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4455s"></a>Paul''s Defense before the Jews</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> "Brethren and fathers, hear my defense which I now <i>offer</i> to you."
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew dialect, they became even more quiet; and he *said,
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated under Gamaliel, strictly according to the law of our fathers, being zealous for God just as you all are today.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> "I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and putting both men and women into prisons,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> as also the high priest and all the Council of the elders can testify. From them I also received letters to the brethren, and started off for Damascus in order to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> "But it happened that as I was on my way, approaching Damascus about noontime, a very bright light suddenly flashed from heaven all around me,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, <font color="red">''Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?''</font>
<br><font size="-1">8</font> "And I answered, ''Who are You, Lord?'' And He said to me, <font color="red">''I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.''</font>
<br><font size="-1">9</font> "And those who were with me saw the light, to be sure, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> "And I said, ''What shall I do, Lord?'' And the Lord said to me, <font color="red">''Get up and go on into Damascus, and there you will be told of all that has been appointed for you to do.''</font>
<br><font size="-1">11</font> "But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> "A certain Ananias, a man who was devout by the standard of the Law, <i>and</i> well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> came to me, and standing near said to me, ''Brother Saul, receive your sight!'' And at that very time I looked up at him.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> "And he said, ''The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will and to see the Righteous One and to hear an utterance from His mouth.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> ''For you will be a witness for Him to all men of what you have seen and heard.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> ''Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.''
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> "It happened when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I fell into a trance,
<br><font size="-1">18</font> and I saw Him saying to me, <font color="red">''Make haste, and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me.''</font>
<br><font size="-1">19</font> "And I said, ''Lord, they themselves understand that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believed in You.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> ''And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed, I also was standing by approving, and watching out for the coats of those who were slaying him.''
<br><font size="-1">21</font> "And He said to me, <font color="red">''Go! For I will send you far away to the Gentiles.''</font>"
<br><font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> They listened to him up to this statement, and <i>then</i> they raised their voices and said, "Away with such a fellow from the earth, for he should not be allowed to live!"
<br><font size="-1">23</font> And as they were crying out and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air,
<br><font size="-1">24</font> the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, stating that he should be examined by scourging so that he might find out the reason why they were shouting against him that way.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> But when they stretched him out with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?"
<br><font size="-1">26</font> When the centurion heard <i>this,</i> he went to the commander and told him, saying, "What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman."
<br><font size="-1">27</font> The commander came and said to him, "Tell me, are you a Roman?" And he said, "Yes."
<br><font size="-1">28</font> The commander answered, "I acquired this citizenship with a large sum of money." And Paul said, "But I was actually born <i>a citizen.</i>"
<br><font size="-1">29</font> Therefore those who were about to examine him immediately let go of him; and the commander also was afraid when he found out that he was a Roman, and because he had put him in chains.
<br><font size="-1"><b>30</b></font> But on the next day, wishing to know for certain why he had been accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Council to assemble, and brought Paul down and set him before them.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4423"></a>ACTS: CHAPTER 23&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4456s"></a>Paul before the Council</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Paul, looking intently at the Council, said, "Brethren, I have lived my life with a perfectly good conscience before God up to this day."
<br><font size="-1">2</font> The high priest Ananias commanded those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Then Paul said to him, "God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to try me according to the Law, and in violation of the Law order me to be struck?"
<br><font size="-1">4</font> But the bystanders said, "Do you revile God''s high priest?"
<br><font size="-1">5</font> And Paul said, "I was not aware, brethren, that he was high priest; for it is written, ''Y<font size="-1">OU SHALL NOT SPEAK EVIL OF A RULER OF YOUR PEOPLE</font>.''&nbsp;"
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> But perceiving that one group were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, Paul <i>began</i> crying out in the Council, "Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; I am on trial for the hope and resurrection of the dead!"
<br><font size="-1">7</font> As he said this, there occurred a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor an angel, nor a spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> And there occurred a great uproar; and some of the scribes of the Pharisaic party stood up and <i>began</i> to argue heatedly, saying, "We find nothing wrong with this man; suppose a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"
<br><font size="-1">10</font> And as a great dissension was developing, the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them and ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> But on the night <i>immediately</i> following, the Lord stood at his side and said, <font color="red">"Take courage; for as you have solemnly witnessed to My cause at Jerusalem, so you must witness at Rome also."</font>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4457s"></a>A Conspiracy to Kill Paul</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> When it was day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> There were more than forty who formed this plot.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> They came to the chief priests and the elders and said, "We have bound ourselves under a solemn oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> "Now therefore, you and the Council notify the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case by a more thorough investigation; and we for our part are ready to slay him before he comes near <i>the place.</i>"
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> But the son of Paul''s sister heard of their ambush, and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, "Lead this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him."
<br><font size="-1">18</font> So he took him and led him to the commander and *said, "Paul the prisoner called me to him and asked me to lead this young man to you since he has something to tell you."
<br><font size="-1">19</font> The commander took him by the hand and stepping aside, <i>began</i> to inquire of him privately, "What is it that you have to report to me?"
<br><font size="-1">20</font> And he said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Council, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more thoroughly about him.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> "So do not listen to them, for more than forty of them are lying in wait for him who have bound themselves under a curse not to eat or drink until they slay him; and now they are ready and waiting for the promise from you."
<br><font size="-1">22</font> So the commander let the young man go, instructing him, "Tell no one that you have notified me of these things."
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4458s"></a>Paul Moved to Caesarea</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">23</font> And he called to him two of the centurions and said, "Get two hundred soldiers ready by the third hour of the night to proceed to Caesarea, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen."
<br><font size="-1">24</font> <i>They were</i> also to provide mounts to put Paul on and bring him safely to Felix the governor.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> And he wrote a letter having this form:
<br><font size="-1"><b>26</b></font> "Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.
<br><font size="-1"><b>27</b></font> "When this man was arrested by the Jews and was about to be slain by them, I came up to them with the troops and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> "And wanting to ascertain the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Council;
<br><font size="-1">29</font> and I found him to be accused over questions about their Law, but under no accusation deserving death or imprisonment.
<br><font size="-1"><b>30</b></font> "When I was informed that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, also instructing his accusers to bring charges against him before you."
<br><font size="-1"><b>31</b></font> So the soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> But the next day, leaving the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the barracks.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> When these had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> When he had read it, he asked from what province he was, and when he learned that he was from Cilicia,
<br><font size="-1">35</font> he said, "I will give you a hearing after your accusers arrive also," giving orders for him to be kept in Herod''s Praetorium.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4424"></a>ACTS: CHAPTER 24&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4459s"></a>Paul before Felix</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> After five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders, with an attorney <i>named</i> Tertullus, and they brought charges to the governor against Paul.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> After <i>Paul</i> had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying <i>to the governor,</i>
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> "Since we have through you attained much peace, and since by your providence reforms are being carried out for this nation,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> we acknowledge <i>this</i> in every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> "But, that I may not weary you any further, I beg you to grant us, by your kindness, a brief hearing.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> "For we have found this man a real pest and a fellow who stirs up dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> "And he even tried to desecrate the temple; and then we arrested him. [We wanted to judge him according to our own Law.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> "But Lysias the commander came along, and with much violence took him out of our hands,
<br><font size="-1">8</font> ordering his accusers to come before you.] By examining him yourself concerning all these matters you will be able to ascertain the things of which we accuse him."
<br><font size="-1">9</font> The Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were so.
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> When the governor had nodded for him to speak, Paul responded:
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> "Knowing that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I cheerfully make my defense,
<br><font size="-1">11</font> since you can take note of the fact that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> "Neither in the temple, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city <i>itself</i> did they find me carrying on a discussion with anyone or causing a riot.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> "Nor can they prove to you <i>the charges</i> of which they now accuse me.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> "But this I admit to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect I do serve the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets;
<br><font size="-1">15</font> having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves, that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> "In view of this, I also do my best to maintain always a blameless conscience <i>both</i> before God and before men.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> "Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings;
<br><font size="-1">18</font> in which they found me <i>occupied</i> in the temple, having been purified, without <i>any</i> crowd or uproar. But <i>there were</i> some Jews from Asia&#151;
<br><font size="-1">19</font> who ought to have been present before you and to make accusation, if they should have anything against me.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> "Or else let these men themselves tell what misdeed they found when I stood before the Council,
<br><font size="-1">21</font> other than for this one statement which I shouted out while standing among them, ''For the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today.''&nbsp;"
<br><font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> But Felix, having a more exact knowledge about the Way, put them off, saying, "When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case."
<br><font size="-1">23</font> Then he gave orders to the centurion for him to be kept in custody and <i>yet</i> have <i>some</i> freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from ministering to him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>24</b></font> But some days later Felix arrived with Drusilla, his wife who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him <i>speak</i> about faith in Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, "Go away for the present, and when I find time I will summon you."
<br><font size="-1">26</font> At the same time too, he was hoping that money would be given him by Paul; therefore he also used to send for him quite often and converse with him.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> But after two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and wishing to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul imprisoned.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4425"></a>ACTS: CHAPTER 25&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4460s"></a>Paul before Festus</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Festus then, having arrived in the province, three days later went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> And the chief priests and the leading men of the Jews brought charges against Paul, and they were urging him,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> requesting a concession against Paul, that he might have him brought to Jerusalem (<i>at the same time,</i> setting an ambush to kill him on the way).
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Festus then answered that Paul was being kept in custody at Caesarea and that he himself was about to leave shortly.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> "Therefore," he *said, "let the influential men among you go there with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them prosecute him."
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> After he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> After Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him which they could not prove,
<br><font size="-1">8</font> while Paul said in his own defense, "I have committed no offense either against the Law of the Jews or against the temple or against Caesar."
<br><font size="-1">9</font> But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul and said, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me on these <i>charges?</i>"
<br><font size="-1">10</font> But Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar''s tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to <i>the</i> Jews, as you also very well know.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> "If, then, I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of those things is <i>true</i> of which these men accuse me, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar."
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Then when Festus had conferred with his council, he answered, "You have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you shall go."
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> Now when several days had elapsed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and paid their respects to Festus.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> While they were spending many days there, Festus laid Paul''s case before the king, saying, "There is a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix;
<br><font size="-1">15</font> and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> "I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man before the accused meets his accusers face to face and has an opportunity to make his defense against the charges.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> "So after they had assembled here, I did not delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought before me.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> "When the accusers stood up, they <i>began</i> bringing charges against him not of such crimes as I was expecting,
<br><font size="-1">19</font> but they <i>simply</i> had some points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a dead man, Jesus, whom Paul asserted to be alive.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> "Being at a loss how to investigate such matters, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there stand trial on these matters.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> "But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for the Emperor''s decision, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I send him to Caesar."
<br><font size="-1">22</font> Then Agrippa <i>said</i> to Festus, "I also would like to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," he *said, "you shall hear him."
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4461s"></a>Paul before Agrippa</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> So, on the next day when Agrippa came together with Bernice amid great pomp, and entered the auditorium accompanied by the commanders and the prominent men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> Festus *said, "King Agrippa, and all you gentlemen here present with us, you see this man about whom all the people of the Jews appealed to me, both at Jerusalem and here, loudly declaring that he ought not to live any longer.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> "But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death; and since he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> "Yet I have nothing definite about him to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him before you <i>all</i> and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the investigation has taken place, I may have something to write.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> "For it seems absurd to me in sending a prisoner, not to indicate also the charges against him."
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4426"></a>ACTS: CHAPTER 26&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4462s"></a>Paul''s Defense before Agrippa</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Agrippa said to Paul, "You are permitted to speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand and <i>proceeded</i> to make his defense:
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> "In regard to all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, that I am about to make my defense before you today;
<br><font size="-1">3</font> especially because you are an expert in all customs and questions among <i>the</i> Jews; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> "So then, all Jews know my manner of life from my youth up, which from the beginning was spent among my <i>own</i> nation and at Jerusalem;
<br><font size="-1">5</font> since they have known about me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that I lived <i>as</i> a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our religion.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> "And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> <i>the promise</i> to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly serve <i>God</i> night and day. And for this hope, O King, I am being accused by Jews.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> "Why is it considered incredible among you <i>people</i> if God does raise the dead?
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> "So then, I thought to myself that I had to do many things hostile to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> "And this is just what I did in Jerusalem; not only did I lock up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, but also when they were being put to death I cast my vote against them.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> "And as I punished them often in all the synagogues, I tried to force them to blaspheme; and being furiously enraged at them, I kept pursuing them even to foreign cities.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> "While so engaged as I was journeying to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> at midday, O King, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining all around me and those who were journeying with me.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> "And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew dialect, <font color="red">''Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.''</font>
<br><font size="-1">15</font> "And I said, ''Who are You, Lord?'' And the Lord said, <font color="red">''I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</font>
<br><font size="-1">16</font> <font color="red">''But get up and stand on your feet; for this purpose I have appeared to you, to appoint you a minister and a witness not only to the things which you have seen, but also to the things in which I will appear to you;</font>
<br><font size="-1">17</font> <font color="red">rescuing you from the <i>Jewish</i> people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,</font>

<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> "So, King Agrippa, I did not prove disobedient to the heavenly vision,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> but <i>kept</i> declaring both to those of Damascus first, and <i>also</i> at Jerusalem and <i>then</i> throughout all the region of Judea, and <i>even</i> to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds appropriate to repentance.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> "For this reason <i>some</i> Jews seized me in the temple and tried to put me to death.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> "So, having obtained help from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, stating nothing but what the Prophets and Moses said was going to take place;
<br><font size="-1">23</font> that the Christ was to suffer, <i>and</i> that by reason of <i>His</i> resurrection from the dead He would be the first to proclaim light both to the <i>Jewish</i> people and to the Gentiles."
<br><font size="-1"><b>24</b></font> While <i>Paul</i> was saying this in his defense, Festus *said in a loud voice, "Paul, you are out of your mind! <i>Your</i> great learning is driving you mad."
<br><font size="-1">25</font> But Paul *said, "I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I utter words of sober truth.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> "For the king knows about these matters, and I speak to him also with confidence, since I am persuaded that none of these things escape his notice; for this has not been done in a corner.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> "King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you do."
<br><font size="-1">28</font> Agrippa <i>replied</i> to Paul, "In a short time you will persuade me to become a Christian."
<br><font size="-1">29</font> And Paul <i>said,</i> "I would wish to God, that whether in a short or long time, not only you, but also all who hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these chains."
<br><font size="-1"><b>30</b></font> The king stood up and the governor and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them,

<br><font size="-1">32</font> And Agrippa said to Festus, "This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."

<font size="-1">1</font> When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, they proceeded to deliver Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan cohort named Julius.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> And embarking in an Adramyttian ship, which was about to sail to the regions along the coast of Asia, we put out to sea accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul with consideration and allowed him to go to his friends and receive care.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> From there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were contrary.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> When we had sailed through the sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> When we had sailed slowly for a good many days, and with difficulty had arrived off Cnidus, since the wind did not permit us <i>to go</i> farther, we sailed under the shelter of Crete, off Salmone;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> and with difficulty sailing past it we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> When considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, since even the fast was already over, Paul <i>began</i> to admonish them,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> and said to them, "Men, I perceive that the voyage will certainly be with damage and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."
<br><font size="-1">11</font> But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the captain of the ship than by what was being said by Paul.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Because the harbor was not suitable for wintering, the majority reached a decision to put out to sea from there, if somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter <i>there.</i>
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> When a moderate south wind came up, supposing that they had attained their purpose, they weighed anchor and <i>began</i> sailing along Crete, close <i>inshore.</i>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4464s"></a>Shipwreck</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">14</font> But before very long there rushed down from the land a violent wind, called Euraquilo;
<br><font size="-1">15</font> and when the ship was caught <i>in it</i> and could not face the wind, we gave way <i>to it</i> and let ourselves be driven along.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Running under the shelter of a small island called Clauda, we were scarcely able to get the <i>ship''s</i> boat under control.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> After they had hoisted it up, they used supporting cables in undergirding the ship; and fearing that they might run aground on <i>the shallows</i> of Syrtis, they let down the sea anchor and in this way let themselves be driven along.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> The next day as we were being violently storm-tossed, they began to jettison the cargo;
<br><font size="-1">19</font> and on the third day they threw the ship''s tackle overboard with their own hands.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> Since neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm was assailing <i>us,</i> from then on all hope of our being saved was gradually abandoned.
<br><font size="-1"><b>21</b></font> When they had gone a long time without food, then Paul stood up in their midst and said, "Men, you ought to have followed my advice and not to have set sail from Crete and incurred this damage and loss.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> "<i>Yet</i> now I urge you to keep up your courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but <i>only</i> of the ship.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> "For this very night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood before me,
<br><font size="-1">24</font> saying, ''Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those who are sailing with you.''
<br><font size="-1">25</font> "Therefore, keep up your courage, men, for I believe God that it will turn out exactly as I have been told.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> "But we must run aground on a certain island."
<br><font size="-1"><b>27</b></font> But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors <i>began</i> to surmise that they were approaching some land.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> They took soundings and found <i>it to be</i> twenty fathoms; and a little farther on they took another sounding and found <i>it to be</i> fifteen fathoms.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> Fearing that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks, they cast four anchors from the stern and wished for daybreak.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> But as the sailors were trying to escape from the ship and had let down the <i>ship''s</i> boat into the sea, on the pretense of intending to lay out anchors from the bow,
<br><font size="-1">31</font> Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these men remain in the ship, you yourselves cannot be saved."
<br><font size="-1">32</font> Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the <i>ship''s</i> boat and let it fall away.
<br><font size="-1"><b>33</b></font> Until the day was about to dawn, Paul was encouraging them all to take some food, saying, "Today is the fourteenth day that you have been constantly watching and going without eating, having taken nothing.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> "Therefore I encourage you to take some food, for this is for your preservation, for not a hair from the head of any of you will perish."
<br><font size="-1">35</font> Having said this, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it and began to eat.
<br><font size="-1">36</font> All of them were encouraged and they themselves also took food.
<br><font size="-1">37</font> All of us in the ship were two hundred and seventy-six persons.
<br><font size="-1">38</font> When they had eaten enough, they <i>began</i> to lighten the ship by throwing out the wheat into the sea.
<br><font size="-1"><b>39</b></font> When day came, they could not recognize the land; but they did observe a bay with a beach, and they resolved to drive the ship onto it if they could.
<br><font size="-1">40</font> And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea while at the same time they were loosening the ropes of the rudders; and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they were heading for the beach.
<br><font size="-1">41</font> But striking a reef where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern <i>began</i> to be broken up by the force <i>of the waves.</i>
<br><font size="-1">42</font> The soldiers'' plan was to kill the prisoners, so that none <i>of them</i> would swim away and escape;
<br><font size="-1">43</font> but the centurion, wanting to bring Paul safely through, kept them from their intention, and commanded that those who could swim should jump overboard first and get to land,
<br><font size="-1">44</font> and the rest <i>should follow,</i> some on planks, and others on various things from the ship. And so it happened that they all were brought safely to land.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4465s"></a>Safe at Malta</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> When they had been brought safely through, then we found out that the island was called Malta.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> The natives showed us extraordinary kindness; for because of the rain that had set in and because of the cold, they kindled a fire and received us all.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they <i>began</i> saying to one another, "Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, and though he has been saved from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live."
<br><font size="-1">5</font> However he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But they were expecting that he was about to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had waited a long time and had seen nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and <i>began</i> to say that he was a god.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the leading man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us courteously three days.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> And it happened that the father of Publius was lying <i>in bed</i> afflicted with <i>recurrent</i> fever and dysentery; and Paul went in <i>to see</i> him and after he had prayed, he laid his hands on him and healed him.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> After this had happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases were coming to him and getting cured.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> They also honored us with many marks of respect; and when we were setting sail, they supplied <i>us</i> with all we needed.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4466s"></a>Paul Arrives at Rome</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> At the end of three months we set sail on an Alexandrian ship which had wintered at the island, and which had the Twin Brothers for its figurehead.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> After we put in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium, and a day later a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> There we found <i>some</i> brethren, and were invited to stay with them for seven days; and thus we came to Rome.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> And the brethren, when they heard about us, came from there as far as the Market of Appius and Three Inns to meet us; and when Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> After three days Paul called together those who were the leading men of the Jews, and when they came together, he <i>began</i> saying to them, "Brethren, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> "And when they had examined me, they were willing to release me because there was no ground for putting me to death.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> "But when the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar, not that I had any accusation against my nation.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> "For this reason, therefore, I requested to see you and to speak with you, for I am wearing this chain for the sake of the hope of Israel."
<br><font size="-1">21</font> They said to him, "We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren come here and reported or spoken anything bad about you.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> "But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere."
<br><font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> When they had set a day for Paul, they came to him at his lodging in large numbers; and he was explaining to them by solemnly testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus, from both the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from morning until evening.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> Some were being persuaded by the things spoken, but others would not believe.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> And when they did not agree with one another, they <i>began</i> leaving after Paul had spoken one <i>parting</i> word, "The Holy Spirit rightly spoke through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers,
<br><font size="-1">26</font> saying, <br>''G<font size="-1">O TO THIS PEOPLE AND SAY</font>, <br>"Y<font size="-1">OU WILL KEEP ON HEARING</font>, <font size="-1">BUT WILL NOT UNDERSTAND</font>; <br>A<font size="-1">ND</font> <font size="-1">YOU WILL KEEP ON SEEING</font>, <font size="-1">BUT WILL NOT PERCEIVE</font>;

<br><font size="-1">28</font> "Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will also listen."
<br><font size="-1">29</font> [When he had spoken these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.]
<br><font size="-1"><b>30</b></font> And he stayed two full years in his own rented quarters and was welcoming all who came to him,
<br><font size="-1">31</font> preaching the kingdom of God and teaching concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all openness, unhindered.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="451s"></a>The Gospel Exalted</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called <i>as</i> an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> who was declared the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead, according to the Spirit of holiness, Jesus Christ our Lord,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about <i>the</i> obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for His name''s sake,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ;
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> to all who are beloved of God in Rome, called <i>as</i> saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For God, whom I serve in my spirit in the <i>preaching of the</i> gospel of His Son, is my witness <i>as to</i> how unceasingly I make mention of you,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> always in my prayers making request, if perhaps now at last by the will of God I may succeed in coming to you.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For I long to see you so that I may impart some spiritual gift to you, that you may be established;
<br><font size="-1">12</font> that is, that I may be encouraged together with you <i>while</i> among you, each of us by the other''s faith, both yours and mine.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that often I have planned to come to you (and have been prevented so far) so that I may obtain some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> So, for my part, I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For in it <i>the</i> righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, "B<font size="-1">UT THE RIGHTEOUS</font> <i>man</i> <font size="-1">SHALL LIVE BY</font> <font size="-1">FAITH</font>."
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="452s"></a>Unbelief and Its Consequences</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,
<br><font size="-1">19</font> because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> Professing to be wise, they became fools,
<br><font size="-1">23</font> and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.
<br><font size="-1"><b>24</b></font> Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
<br><font size="-1"><b>26</b></font> For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural,
<br><font size="-1">27</font> and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.
<br><font size="-1"><b>28</b></font> And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper,
<br><font size="-1">29</font> being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; <i>they are</i> gossips,
<br><font size="-1">30</font> slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,
<br><font size="-1">31</font> without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful;
<br><font size="-1">32</font> and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="452"></a>ROMANS: CHAPTER 2&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="453s"></a>The Impartiality of God</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore you have no excuse, everyone of you who passes judgment, for in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> And we know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who practice such things.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> But do you suppose this, O man, when you pass judgment on those who practice such things and do the same <i>yourself,</i> that you will escape the judgment of God?
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?
<br><font size="-1">5</font> But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> who <font size="-1">WILL RENDER TO EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS</font> <font size="-1">DEEDS</font>:
<br><font size="-1">7</font> to those who by perseverance in doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> but to those who are selfishly ambitious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, wrath and indignation.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> <i>There will be</i> tribulation and distress for every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For there is no partiality with God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish without the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law;
<br><font size="-1">13</font> for <i>it is</i> not the hearers of the Law <i>who</i> are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves,
<br><font size="-1">15</font> in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="454s"></a>The Jew Is Condemned by the Law</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> But if you bear the name "Jew" and rely upon the Law and boast in God,
<br><font size="-1">18</font> and know <i>His</i> will and approve the things that are essential, being instructed out of the Law,
<br><font size="-1">19</font> and are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth,
<br><font size="-1">21</font> you, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that one shall not steal, do you steal?
<br><font size="-1">22</font> You who say that one should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
<br><font size="-1">23</font> You who boast in the Law, through your breaking the Law, do you dishonor God?
<br><font size="-1">24</font> For "<font size="-1">THE NAME OF</font> G<font size="-1">OD IS BLASPHEMED AMONG THE</font> G<font size="-1">ENTILES</font> <font size="-1">BECAUSE OF YOU</font>," just as it is written.
<br><font size="-1"><b>25</b></font> For indeed circumcision is of value if you practice the Law; but if you are a transgressor of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> So if the uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?
<br><font size="-1">27</font> And he who is physically uncircumcised, if he keeps the Law, will he not judge you who though having the letter <i>of the Law</i> and circumcision are a transgressor of the Law?
<br><font size="-1">28</font> For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="453"></a>ROMANS: CHAPTER 3&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="455s"></a>All the World Guilty</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Great in every respect. First of all, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> What then? If some did not believe, their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God, will it?
<br><font size="-1">4</font> May it never be! Rather, let God be found true, though every man <i>be found</i> a liar, as it is written, <br>"T<font size="-1">HAT</font> Y<font size="-1">OU MAY BE JUSTIFIED IN</font> Y<font size="-1">OUR WORDS</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND PREVAIL WHEN</font> Y<font size="-1">OU</font> <font size="-1">ARE JUDGED</font>."
<br><font size="-1">5</font> But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? The God who inflicts wrath is not unrighteous, is He? (I am speaking in human terms.)
<br><font size="-1">6</font> May it never be! For otherwise, how will God judge the world?
<br><font size="-1">7</font> But if through my lie the truth of God abounded to His glory, why am I also still being judged as a sinner?
<br><font size="-1">8</font> And why not <i>say</i> (as we are slanderously reported and as some claim that we say), "Let us do evil that good may come"? Their condemnation is just.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> What then? Are we better than they? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin;
<br><font size="-1">10</font> as it is written, <br>"T<font size="-1">HERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS</font>, <font size="-1">NOT EVEN ONE</font>;

<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be closed and all the world may become accountable to God;
<br><font size="-1">20</font> because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law <i>comes</i> the knowledge of sin.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="456s"></a>Justification by Faith</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>21</b></font> But now apart from the Law <i>the</i> righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,
<br><font size="-1">22</font> even <i>the</i> righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction;
<br><font size="-1">23</font> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
<br><font size="-1">24</font> being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus;
<br><font size="-1">25</font> whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. <i>This was</i> to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed;
<br><font size="-1">26</font> for the demonstration, <i>I say,</i> of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.
<br><font size="-1"><b>27</b></font> Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> Or is God <i>the God</i> of Jews only? Is He not <i>the God</i> of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,
<br><font size="-1">30</font> since indeed God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith is one.
<br><font size="-1"><b>31</b></font> Do we then nullify the Law through faith? May it never be! On the contrary, we establish the Law.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="457s"></a>Justification by Faith Evidenced in Old Testament</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found?
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For what does the Scripture say? "A<font size="-1">BRAHAM BELIEVED</font> G<font size="-1">OD</font>, <font size="-1">AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS</font>."
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:
<br><font size="-1">7</font> "B<font size="-1">LESSED ARE THOSE WHOSE LAWLESS DEEDS</font> <font size="-1">HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND WHOSE SINS HAVE BEEN COVERED</font>.

<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> Is this blessing then on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also? For we say, "F<font size="-1">AITH WAS CREDITED TO</font> A<font size="-1">BRAHAM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS</font>."
<br><font size="-1">10</font> How then was it credited? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised;
<br><font size="-1">11</font> and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, that righteousness might be credited to them,
<br><font size="-1">12</font> and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while uncircumcised.
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For if those who are of the Law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise is nullified;
<br><font size="-1">15</font> for the Law brings about wrath, but where there is no law, there also is no violation.
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> For this reason <i>it is</i> by faith, in order that <i>it may be</i> in accordance with grace, so that the promise will be guaranteed to all the descendants, not only to those who are of the Law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,
<br><font size="-1">17</font> (as it is written, "A <font size="-1">FATHER OF MANY NATIONS HAVE</font> I <font size="-1">MADE YOU</font>") in the presence of Him whom he believed, <i>even</i> God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, "S<font size="-1">O SHALL YOUR</font> <font size="-1">DESCENDANTS BE</font>."
<br><font size="-1">19</font> Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah''s womb;
<br><font size="-1">20</font> yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God,
<br><font size="-1">21</font> and being fully assured that what God had promised, He was able also to perform.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> Therefore <font size="-1">IT WAS ALSO CREDITED TO HIM AS</font> <font size="-1">RIGHTEOUSNESS</font>.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> Now not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him,
<br><font size="-1">24</font> but for our sake also, to whom it will be credited, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,
<br><font size="-1">25</font> <i>He</i> who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="455"></a>ROMANS: CHAPTER 5&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="458s"></a>Results of Justification</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope of the glory of God.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope;
<br><font size="-1">5</font> and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For one will hardly die for a righteous man; though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath <i>of God</i> through Him.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned&#151;
<br><font size="-1">13</font> for until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come.
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> The gift is not like <i>that which came</i> through the one who sinned; for on the one hand the judgment <i>arose</i> from one <i>transgression</i> resulting in condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift <i>arose</i> from many transgressions resulting in justification.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> For as through the one man''s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,
<br><font size="-1">21</font> so that, as sin reigned in death, even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="459s"></a>Believers Are Dead to Sin, Alive to God</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase?
<br><font size="-1">2</font> May it never be! How shall we who died to sin still live in it?
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For if we have become united with <i>Him</i> in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be <i>in the likeness</i> of His resurrection,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> knowing this, that our old self was crucified with <i>Him,</i> in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> for he who has died is freed from sin.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,
<br><font size="-1">9</font> knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, is never to die again; death no longer is master over Him.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin <i>as</i> instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your members <i>as</i> instruments of righteousness to God.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace.
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be!
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone <i>as</i> slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin resulting in death, or of obedience resulting in righteousness?
<br><font size="-1">17</font> But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed,
<br><font size="-1">18</font> and having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, resulting in <i>further</i> lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification.
<br><font size="-1"><b>20</b></font> For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> Therefore what benefit were you then deriving from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the outcome of those things is death.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="457"></a>ROMANS: CHAPTER 7&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4510s"></a>Believers United to Christ</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Or do you not know, brethren (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law has jurisdiction over a person as long as he lives?
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is living; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning the husband.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> So then, if while her husband is living she is joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress though she is joined to another man.
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> Therefore, my brethren, you also were made to die to the Law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were <i>aroused</i> by the Law, were at work in the members of our body to bear fruit for death.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But now we have been released from the Law, having died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? May it never be! On the contrary, I would not have come to know sin except through the Law; for I would not have known about coveting if the Law had not said, "Y<font size="-1">OU</font> <font size="-1">SHALL NOT</font> <font size="-1">COVET</font>."
<br><font size="-1">8</font> But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me coveting of every kind; for apart from the Law sin <i>is</i> dead.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> I was once alive apart from the Law; but when the commandment came, sin became alive and I died;
<br><font size="-1">10</font> and this commandment, which was to result in life, proved to result in death for me;
<br><font size="-1">11</font> for sin, taking an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> Therefore did that which is good become <i>a cause</i> <i>of</i> death for me? May it never be! Rather it was sin, in order that it might be shown to be sin by effecting my death through that which is good, so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4511s"></a>The Conflict of Two Natures</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold into bondage to sin.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I <i>would</i> like to <i>do,</i> but I am doing the very thing I hate.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> But if I do the very thing I do not want <i>to do,</i> I agree with the Law, <i>confessing</i> that the Law is good.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> So now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good <i>is</i> not.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.
<br><font size="-1"><b>21</b></font> I find then the principle that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> For I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man,
<br><font size="-1">23</font> but I see a different law in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> Wretched man that I am! Who will set me free from the body of this death?
<br><font size="-1">25</font> Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="458"></a>ROMANS: CHAPTER 8&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4512s"></a>Deliverance from Bondage</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God <i>did:</i> sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and <i>as an offering</i> for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> so that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able <i>to do so,</i>
<br><font size="-1">8</font> and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> So then, brethren, we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh&#151;
<br><font size="-1">13</font> for if you are living according to the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, "Abba! Father!"
<br><font size="-1">16</font> The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God,
<br><font size="-1">17</font> and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with <i>Him</i> so that we may also be glorified with <i>Him.</i>
<br><font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope
<br><font size="-1">21</font> that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> And not only this, but also we ourselves, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly for <i>our</i> adoption as sons, the redemption of our body.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what he <i>already</i> sees?
<br><font size="-1">25</font> But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we wait eagerly for it.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4513s"></a>Our Victory in Christ</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>26</b></font> In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for <i>us</i> with groanings too deep for words;
<br><font size="-1">27</font> and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to <i>the will of</i> God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>28</b></font> And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to <i>His</i> purpose.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined <i>to become</i> conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren;
<br><font size="-1">30</font> and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.
<br><font size="-1"><b>31</b></font> What then shall we say to these things? If God <i>is</i> for us, who <i>is</i> against us?
<br><font size="-1">32</font> He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?
<br><font size="-1">33</font> Who will bring a charge against God''s elect? God is the one who justifies;
<br><font size="-1">34</font> who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, yes, rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.
<br><font size="-1">35</font> Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
<br><font size="-1">36</font> Just as it is written, <br>"F<font size="-1">OR</font> Y<font size="-1">OUR SAKE WE ARE BEING PUT TO DEATH ALL DAY LONG</font>; <br>W<font size="-1">E WERE CONSIDERED AS SHEEP TO BE SLAUGHTERED</font>."
<br><font size="-1">37</font> But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us.
<br><font size="-1">38</font> For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
<br><font size="-1">39</font> nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

<br><font size="-1">8</font> That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For this is the word of promise: "A<font size="-1">T THIS TIME</font> I <font size="-1">WILL COME</font>, <font size="-1">AND</font> S<font size="-1">ARAH SHALL HAVE A SON</font>."
<br><font size="-1">10</font> And not only this, but there was Rebekah also, when she had conceived <i>twins</i> by one man, our father Isaac;
<br><font size="-1">11</font> for though <i>the twins</i> were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that God''s purpose according to <i>His</i> choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls,
<br><font size="-1">12</font> it was said to her, "T<font size="-1">HE OLDER WILL SERVE</font> <font size="-1">THE YOUNGER</font>."
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Just as it is written, "J<font size="-1">ACOB</font> I <font size="-1">LOVED, BUT</font> E<font size="-1">SAU</font> I <font size="-1">HATED</font>."
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be!
<br><font size="-1">15</font> For He says to Moses, "I <font size="-1">WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM</font> I <font size="-1">HAVE MERCY</font>, <font size="-1">AND</font> I <font size="-1">WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM</font> I <font size="-1">HAVE COMPASSION</font>."
<br><font size="-1">16</font> So then it <i>does</i> not <i>depend</i> on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "F<font size="-1">OR THIS</font> <font size="-1">VERY PURPOSE</font> I <font size="-1">RAISED YOU UP</font>, <font size="-1">TO DEMONSTRATE</font> M<font size="-1">Y POWER IN YOU</font>, <font size="-1">AND THAT</font> M<font size="-1">Y NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED</font> <font size="-1">THROUGHOUT THE</font> <font size="-1">WHOLE EARTH</font>."
<br><font size="-1">18</font> So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires.
<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> You will say to me then, "Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?"
<br><font size="-1">20</font> On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, "Why did you make me like this," will it?
<br><font size="-1">21</font> Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use?
<br><font size="-1">22</font> What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?
<br><font size="-1">23</font> And <i>He did so</i> to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory,
<br><font size="-1">24</font> <i>even</i> us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> As He says also in Hosea, <br>"I <font size="-1">WILL CALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT</font> M<font size="-1">Y PEOPLE</font>, ''M<font size="-1">Y PEOPLE</font>,'' <br>A<font size="-1">ND HER WHO WAS NOT BELOVED</font>, ''<font size="-1">BELOVED</font>.''&nbsp;"
<br><font size="-1">26</font> "A<font size="-1">ND IT SHALL BE THAT IN THE PLACE WHERE</font> <font size="-1">IT WAS SAID TO THEM</font>, ''<font size="-1">YOU ARE NOT</font> M<font size="-1">Y PEOPLE</font>,'' <br>T<font size="-1">HERE THEY SHALL BE CALLED SONS OF</font> <font size="-1">THE</font> <font size="-1">LIVING</font> G<font size="-1">OD</font>."
<br><font size="-1"><b>27</b></font> Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, "T<font size="-1">HOUGH THE NUMBER OF THE SONS OF</font> I<font size="-1">SRAEL BE</font> <font size="-1">LIKE THE SAND OF THE SEA</font>, <font size="-1">IT IS</font> <font size="-1">THE REMNANT THAT WILL BE SAVED</font>;
<br><font size="-1">28</font> <font size="-1">FOR THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD WILL EXECUTE</font> H<font size="-1">IS WORD ON THE</font> <font size="-1">EARTH</font>, <font size="-1">THOROUGHLY AND</font> <font size="-1">QUICKLY</font>."
<br><font size="-1">29</font> And just as Isaiah foretold, <br>"U<font size="-1">NLESS</font> <font size="-1">THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD OF</font> S<font size="-1">ABAOTH HAD LEFT TO US A</font> <font size="-1">POSTERITY</font>, <br>W<font size="-1">E WOULD HAVE BECOME LIKE</font> S<font size="-1">ODOM</font>, <font size="-1">AND WOULD HAVE</font> <font size="-1">RESEMBLED</font> G<font size="-1">OMORRAH</font>."
<br><font size="-1"><b>30</b></font> What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith;
<br><font size="-1">31</font> but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at <i>that</i> law.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> Why? Because <i>they did</i> not <i>pursue it</i> by faith, but as though <i>it were</i> by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,
<br><font size="-1">33</font> just as it is written, <br>"B<font size="-1">EHOLD</font>, I <font size="-1">LAY IN</font> Z<font size="-1">ION</font> <font size="-1">A STONE OF</font> <font size="-1">STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND HE WHO BELIEVES IN</font> H<font size="-1">IM</font> <font size="-1">WILL NOT BE</font> <font size="-1">DISAPPOINTED</font>."

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4515s"></a>The Word of Faith Brings Salvation</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Brethren, my heart''s desire and my prayer to God for them is for <i>their</i> salvation.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For not knowing about God''s righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law shall live by that righteousness.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But the righteousness based on faith speaks as follows: "D<font size="-1">O NOT SAY IN YOUR HEART</font>, ''W<font size="-1">HO WILL</font> <font size="-1">ASCEND INTO HEAVEN</font>?'' (that is, to bring Christ down),
<br><font size="-1">7</font> or ''W<font size="-1">HO WILL DESCEND INTO THE</font> <font size="-1">ABYSS</font>?'' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead)."
<br><font size="-1">8</font> But what does it say? "T<font size="-1">HE WORD IS NEAR YOU</font>, <font size="-1">IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART</font>"&#151;that is, the word of faith which we are preaching,
<br><font size="-1">9</font> that if you confess with your mouth Jesus <i>as</i> Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;
<br><font size="-1">10</font> for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For the Scripture says, "W<font size="-1">HOEVER BELIEVES IN</font> H<font size="-1">IM WILL NOT BE</font> <font size="-1">DISAPPOINTED</font>."
<br><font size="-1">12</font> For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same <i>Lord</i> is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him;
<br><font size="-1">13</font> for "W<font size="-1">HOEVER WILL CALL ON THE NAME OF THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD WILL BE SAVED</font>."
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher?
<br><font size="-1">15</font> How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, "H<font size="-1">OW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET OF THOSE</font> <font size="-1">WHO</font> <font size="-1">BRING GOOD NEWS OF GOOD THINGS</font>!"
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> However, they did not all heed the good news; for Isaiah says, "L<font size="-1">ORD</font>, <font size="-1">WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR</font> <font size="-1">REPORT</font>?"
<br><font size="-1">17</font> So faith <i>comes</i> from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? Indeed they have; <br>"T<font size="-1">HEIR VOICE HAS GONE OUT INTO ALL THE EARTH</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND THEIR WORDS TO THE ENDS OF THE</font> <font size="-1">WORLD</font>."
<br><font size="-1">19</font> But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they? First Moses says, <br>"I <font size="-1">WILL</font> <font size="-1">MAKE YOU JEALOUS BY THAT</font> <font size="-1">WHICH IS NOT A NATION</font>, <br>B<font size="-1">Y A NATION WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WILL</font> I <font size="-1">ANGER</font> <font size="-1">YOU</font>."
<br><font size="-1">20</font> And Isaiah is very bold and says, <br>"I <font size="-1">WAS FOUND BY THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEK</font> M<font size="-1">E</font>, <br>I <font size="-1">BECAME MANIFEST TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK FOR</font> M<font size="-1">E</font>."
<br><font size="-1">21</font> But as for Israel He says, "A<font size="-1">LL THE DAY LONG</font> I <font size="-1">HAVE STRETCHED OUT</font> M<font size="-1">Y HANDS TO A DISOBEDIENT AND OBSTINATE</font> <font size="-1">PEOPLE</font>."

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4516s"></a>Israel Is Not Cast Away</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? May it never be! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in <i>the passage about</i> Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?
<br><font size="-1">3</font> "Lord, <font size="-1">THEY HAVE KILLED</font> Y<font size="-1">OUR PROPHETS</font>, <font size="-1">THEY HAVE TORN DOWN</font> Y<font size="-1">OUR ALTARS</font>, <font size="-1">AND</font> I <font size="-1">ALONE AM LEFT</font>, <font size="-1">AND THEY ARE SEEKING MY LIFE</font>."
<br><font size="-1">4</font> But what is the divine response to him? "I <font size="-1">HAVE KEPT</font> for Myself <font size="-1">SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WHO</font> <font size="-1">HAVE NOT BOWED THE KNEE TO</font> B<font size="-1">AAL</font>."
<br><font size="-1">5</font> In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to <i>God''s</i> gracious choice.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> just as it is written, <br>"G<font size="-1">OD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR</font>, <br>E<font size="-1">YES TO SEE NOT AND EARS TO HEAR NOT</font>, <br>D<font size="-1">OWN TO THIS VERY DAY</font>."
<br><font size="-1">9</font> And David says, <br>"L<font size="-1">ET THEIR TABLE BECOME A SNARE AND A TRAP</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND A STUMBLING BLOCK AND A RETRIBUTION TO THEM</font>.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> "L<font size="-1">ET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED TO SEE NOT</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND BEND THEIR BACKS FOREVER</font>."
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they? May it never be! But by their transgression salvation <i>has come</i> to the Gentiles, to make them jealous.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> if somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will <i>their</i> acceptance be but life from the dead?
<br><font size="-1">16</font> If the first piece <i>of dough</i> is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are too.
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree,
<br><font size="-1">18</font> do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant, <i>remember that</i> it is not you who supports the root, but the root <i>supports</i> you.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."
<br><font size="-1">20</font> Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear;
<br><font size="-1">21</font> for if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you, either.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> Behold then the kindness and severity of God; to those who fell, severity, but to you, God''s kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are the natural <i>branches</i> be grafted into their own olive tree?
<br><font size="-1"><b>25</b></font> For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery&#151;so that you will not be wise in your own estimation&#151;that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in;
<br><font size="-1">26</font> and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, <br>"T<font size="-1">HE</font> D<font size="-1">ELIVERER WILL COME FROM</font> Z<font size="-1">ION</font>, <br>H<font size="-1">E WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM</font> J<font size="-1">ACOB</font>."
<br><font size="-1">27</font> "T<font size="-1">HIS IS</font> M<font size="-1">Y COVENANT WITH THEM</font>, <br>W<font size="-1">HEN</font> I <font size="-1">TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS</font>."
<br><font size="-1">28</font> From the standpoint of the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of <i>God''s</i> choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers;
<br><font size="-1">29</font> for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience,
<br><font size="-1">31</font> so these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all.
<br><font size="-1"><b>33</b></font> Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!
<br><font size="-1">34</font> For <font size="-1">WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD, OR</font> <font size="-1">WHO BECAME</font> H<font size="-1">IS COUNSELOR</font>?

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4517s"></a>Dedicated Service</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, <i>which is</i> your spiritual service of worship.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, <i>each of us is to exercise them accordingly:</i> if prophecy, according to the proportion of his faith;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his teaching;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> <i>Let</i> love <i>be</i> without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling to what is good.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> <i>Be</i> devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honor;
<br><font size="-1">11</font> not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;
<br><font size="-1">12</font> rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Never pay back evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all men.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath <i>of God,</i> for it is written, "V<font size="-1">ENGEANCE IS</font> M<font size="-1">INE</font>, I <font size="-1">WILL REPAY</font>," says the Lord.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4518s"></a>Be Subject to Government</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience'' sake.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> For because of this you also pay taxes, for <i>rulers</i> are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax <i>is due;</i> custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled <i>the</i> law.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For this, "Y<font size="-1">OU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY,</font> Y<font size="-1">OU</font> <font size="-1">SHALL NOT MURDER</font>, Y<font size="-1">OU SHALL NOT STEAL,</font> Y<font size="-1">OU SHALL NOT</font> <font size="-1">COVET</font>," and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, "Y<font size="-1">OU SHALL LOVE YOUR</font> <font size="-1">NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF</font>."
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of <i>the</i> law.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> <i>Do</i> this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep; for now salvation is nearer to us than when we believed.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> The night is almost gone, and the day is near. Therefore let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Let us behave properly as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality, not in strife and jealousy.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in regard to <i>its</i> lusts.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4519s"></a>Principles of Conscience</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now accept the one who is weak in faith, <i>but</i> not for <i>the purpose of</i> passing judgment on his opinions.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> One person has faith that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables <i>only.</i>
<br><font size="-1">3</font> The one who eats is not to regard with contempt the one who does not eat, and the one who does not eat is not to judge the one who eats, for God has accepted him.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls; and he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.
<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> One person regards one day above another, another regards every day <i>alike.</i> Each person must be fully convinced in his own mind.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord, and he who eats, does so for the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who eats not, for the Lord he does not eat, and gives thanks to God.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For not one of us lives for himself, and not one dies for himself;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> for if we live, we live for the Lord, or if we die, we die for the Lord; therefore whether we live or die, we are the Lord''s.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For to this end Christ died and lived again, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you regard your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For it is written, <br>"A<font size="-1">S</font> I <font size="-1">LIVE</font>, <font size="-1">SAYS THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD</font>, <font size="-1">EVERY</font> <font size="-1">KNEE SHALL BOW TO</font> M<font size="-1">E</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND EVERY TONGUE SHALL</font> <font size="-1">GIVE PRAISE TO</font> G<font size="-1">OD</font>."
<br><font size="-1">12</font> So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather determine this&#151;not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother''s way.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but to him who thinks anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> For if because of food your brother is hurt, you are no longer walking according to love. Do not destroy with your food him for whom Christ died.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Therefore do not let what is for you a good thing be spoken of as evil;
<br><font size="-1">17</font> for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> For he who in this <i>way</i> serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> So then we pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are clean, but they are evil for the man who eats and gives offense.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine, or <i>to do anything</i> by which your brother stumbles.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> The faith which you have, have as your own conviction before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because <i>his eating is</i> not from faith; and whatever is not from faith is sin.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4520s"></a>Self-denial on Behalf of Others</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those without strength and not <i>just</i> please ourselves.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Each of us is to please his neighbor for his good, to his edification.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, "T<font size="-1">HE REPROACHES OF THOSE WHO REPROACHED</font> Y<font size="-1">OU FELL ON</font> M<font size="-1">E</font>."
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> so that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> Therefore, accept one another, just as Christ also accepted us to the glory of God.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm the promises <i>given</i> to the fathers,
<br><font size="-1">9</font> and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written, <br>"T<font size="-1">HEREFORE</font> I <font size="-1">WILL</font> <font size="-1">GIVE PRAISE TO</font> Y<font size="-1">OU AMONG THE</font> G<font size="-1">ENTILES</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND</font> I <font size="-1">WILL SING TO</font> Y<font size="-1">OUR NAME</font>."
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Again he says, <br>"R<font size="-1">EJOICE</font>, O G<font size="-1">ENTILES</font>, <font size="-1">WITH</font> H<font size="-1">IS PEOPLE</font>."
<br><font size="-1">11</font> And again, <br>"P<font size="-1">RAISE THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD ALL YOU</font> G<font size="-1">ENTILES</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND LET ALL THE PEOPLES PRAISE</font> H<font size="-1">IM</font>."
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Again Isaiah says, <br>"T<font size="-1">HERE SHALL COME</font> <font size="-1">THE ROOT OF</font> J<font size="-1">ESSE</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND</font> H<font size="-1">E WHO ARISES TO RULE OVER THE</font> G<font size="-1">ENTILES</font>, <br>I<font size="-1">N</font> H<font size="-1">IM SHALL THE</font> G<font size="-1">ENTILES HOPE</font>."
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> And concerning you, my brethren, I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able also to admonish one another.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given me from God,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, so that <i>my</i> offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Therefore in Christ Jesus I have found reason for boasting in things pertaining to God.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> For I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed,
<br><font size="-1">19</font> in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> And thus I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was <i>already</i> named, so that I would not build on another man''s foundation;
<br><font size="-1">21</font> but as it is written, <br>"T<font size="-1">HEY WHO HAD NO NEWS OF</font> H<font size="-1">IM SHALL SEE</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND THEY WHO HAVE NOT HEARD SHALL UNDERSTAND</font>."
<br><font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> For this reason I have often been prevented from coming to you;
<br><font size="-1">23</font> but now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you
<br><font size="-1">24</font> whenever I go to Spain&#151;for I hope to see you in passing, and to be helped on my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company for a while&#151;
<br><font size="-1">25</font> but now, I am going to Jerusalem serving the saints.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> Yes, they were pleased <i>to do so,</i> and they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are indebted to minister to them also in material things.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> Therefore, when I have finished this, and have put my seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>30</b></font> Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,
<br><font size="-1">31</font> that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and <i>that</i> my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints;
<br><font size="-1">32</font> so that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and find <i>refreshing</i> rest in your company.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="461s"></a>Appeal to Unity</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Paul, called <i>as</i> an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their <i>Lord</i> and ours:
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> that in everything you were enriched in Him, in all speech and all knowledge,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> even as the testimony concerning Christ was confirmed in you,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> so that you are not lacking in any gift, awaiting eagerly the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,
<br><font size="-1">8</font> who will also confirm you to the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For I have been informed concerning you, my brethren, by Chloe''s <i>people,</i> that there are quarrels among you.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Now I mean this, that each one of you is saying, "I am of Paul," and "I of Apollos," and "I of Cephas," and "I of Christ."
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
<br><font size="-1">14</font> I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,
<br><font size="-1">15</font> so that no one would say you were baptized in my name.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Now I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized any other.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not in cleverness of speech, so that the cross of Christ would not be made void.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="462s"></a>The Wisdom of God</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> For it is written, <br>"I <font size="-1">WILL DESTROY THE WISDOM OF THE WISE</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND THE CLEVERNESS OF THE CLEVER</font> I <font size="-1">WILL SET ASIDE</font>."
<br><font size="-1">20</font> Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
<br><font size="-1">21</font> For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not <i>come to</i> know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom;
<br><font size="-1">23</font> but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness,
<br><font size="-1">24</font> but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
<br><font size="-1"><b>26</b></font> For consider your calling, brethren, that there were not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble;
<br><font size="-1">27</font> but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong,
<br><font size="-1">28</font> and the base things of the world and the despised God has chosen, the things that are not, so that He may nullify the things that are,
<br><font size="-1">29</font> so that no man may boast before God.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,
<br><font size="-1">31</font> so that, just as it is written, "L<font size="-1">ET HIM WHO BOASTS</font>, <font size="-1">BOAST IN THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD</font>."
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="462"></a>1 CORINTHIANS: CHAPTER 2&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="463s"></a>Paul''s Reliance upon the Spirit</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> And when I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> but we speak God''s wisdom in a mystery, the hidden <i>wisdom</i> which God predestined before the ages to our glory;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> <i>the wisdom</i> which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;
<br><font size="-1">9</font> but just as it is written, <br>"T<font size="-1">HINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND</font> <i>which</i> <font size="-1">HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">LL THAT</font> G<font size="-1">OD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE</font> H<font size="-1">IM</font>."
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For to us God revealed <i>them</i> through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For who among men knows the <i>thoughts</i> of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the <i>thoughts</i> of God no one knows except the Spirit of God.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual <i>thoughts</i> with spiritual <i>words.</i>
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> For <font size="-1">WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD</font>, <font size="-1">THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT</font> H<font size="-1">IM</font>? But we have the mind of Christ.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="463"></a>1 CORINTHIANS: CHAPTER 3&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="464s"></a>Foundations for Living</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able <i>to receive it.</i> Indeed, even now you are not yet able,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For when one says, "I am of Paul," and another, "I am of Apollos," are you not <i>mere</i> men?
<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave <i>opportunity</i> to each one.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For we are God''s fellow workers; you are God''s field, God''s building.
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> each man''s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is <i>to be</i> revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man''s work.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> If any man''s work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> If any man''s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> Do you not know that you are a temple of God and <i>that</i> the Spirit of God dwells in you?
<br><font size="-1">17</font> If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.
<br><font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become foolish, so that he may become wise.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God. For it is written, "<i>He is</i> <font size="-1">THE ONE WHO CATCHES THE WISE IN THEIR CRAFTINESS</font>";
<br><font size="-1">20</font> and again, "T<font size="-1">HE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD KNOWS THE REASONINGS</font> of the wise, <font size="-1">THAT THEY ARE USELESS</font>."
<br><font size="-1">21</font> So then let no one boast in men. For all things belong to you,
<br><font size="-1">22</font> whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all things belong to you,
<br><font size="-1">23</font> and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="464"></a>1 CORINTHIANS: CHAPTER 4&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="465s"></a>Servants of Christ</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Let a man regard us in this manner, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> In this case, moreover, it is required of stewards that one be found trustworthy.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> But to me it is a very small thing that I may be examined by you, or by <i>any</i> human court; in fact, I do not even examine myself.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For I am conscious of nothing against myself, yet I am not by this acquitted; but the one who examines me is the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Therefore do not go on passing judgment before the time, <i>but wait</i> until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of <i>men''s</i> hearts; and then each man''s praise will come to him from God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that in us you may learn not to exceed what is written, so that no one of you will become arrogant in behalf of one against the other.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For who regards you as superior? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> You are already filled, you have already become rich, you have become kings without us; and indeed, <i>I</i> wish that you had become kings so that we also might reign with you.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as men condemned to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> We are fools for Christ''s sake, but you are prudent in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are distinguished, but we are without honor.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> To this present hour we are both hungry and thirsty, and are poorly clothed, and are roughly treated, and are homeless;
<br><font size="-1">12</font> and we toil, working with our own hands; when we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure;
<br><font size="-1">13</font> when we are slandered, we try to conciliate; we have become as the scum of the world, the dregs of all things, <i>even</i> until now.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> I do not write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet <i>you would</i> not <i>have</i> many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Therefore I exhort you, be imitators of me.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Now some have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I shall find out, not the words of those who are arrogant but their power.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> For the kingdom of God does not consist in words but in power.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="466s"></a>Immorality Rebuked</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> It is actually reported that there is immorality among you, and immorality of such a kind as does not exist even among the Gentiles, that someone has his father''s wife.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> You have become arrogant and have not mourned instead, so that the one who had done this deed would be removed from your midst.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> For I, on my part, though absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged him who has so committed this, as though I were present.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and I with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> <i>I have decided</i> to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump <i>of dough?</i>

<br><font size="-1">11</font> But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler&#151;not even to eat with such a one.

<font size="-1">1</font> Does any one of you, when he has a case against his neighbor, dare to go to law before the unrighteous and not before the saints?
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? If the world is judged by you, are you not competent <i>to</i> <i>constitute</i> the smallest law courts?
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more matters of this life?
<br><font size="-1">4</font> So if you have law courts dealing with matters of this life, do you appoint them as judges who are of no account in the church?
<br><font size="-1">5</font> I say <i>this</i> to your shame. <i>Is it</i> so, <i>that</i> there is not among you one wise man who will be able to decide between his brethren,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> but brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> Actually, then, it is already a defeat for you, that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?
<br><font size="-1">8</font> On the contrary, you yourselves wrong and defraud. <i>You do</i> this even to <i>your</i> brethren.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> nor thieves, nor <i>the</i> covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.

<br><font size="-1">13</font> Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God will do away with both of them. Yet the body is not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Now God has not only raised the Lord, but will also raise us up through His power.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body <i>with her?</i> For He says, "T<font size="-1">HE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH</font>."
<br><font size="-1">17</font> But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit <i>with Him.</i>
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Flee immorality. Every <i>other</i> sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="469s"></a>Teaching on Marriage</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now concerning the things about which you wrote, it is good for a man not to touch a woman.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> But because of immoralities, each man is to have his own wife, and each woman is to have her own husband.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> The husband must fulfill his duty to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband <i>does;</i> and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife <i>does.</i>
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Stop depriving one another, except by agreement for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But this I say by way of concession, not of command.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Yet I wish that all men were even as I myself am. However, each man has his own gift from God, one in this manner, and another in that.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn <i>with passion.</i>
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> But to the married I give instructions, not I, but the Lord, that the wife should not leave her husband
<br><font size="-1">11</font> (but if she does leave, she must remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband should not divorce his wife.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> But to the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to live with her, she must not send her husband away.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband; for otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Yet if the unbelieving one leaves, let him leave; the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such <i>cases,</i> but God has called us to peace.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> Only, as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each, in this manner let him walk. And so I direct in all the churches.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Was any man called <i>when he was already</i> circumcised? He is not to become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? He is not to be circumcised.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but <i>what matters is</i> the keeping of the commandments of God.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> Each man must remain in that condition in which he was called.
<br><font size="-1"><b>21</b></font> Were you called while a slave? Do not worry about it; but if you are able also to become free, rather do that.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> For he who was called in the Lord while a slave, is the Lord''s freedman; likewise he who was called while free, is Christ''s slave.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> Brethren, each one is to remain with God in that <i>condition</i> in which he was called.
<br><font size="-1"><b>25</b></font> Now concerning virgins I have no command of the Lord, but I give an opinion as one who by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> I think then that this is good in view of the present distress, that it is good for a man to remain as he is.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> But if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have trouble in this life, and I am trying to spare you.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> But this I say, brethren, the time has been shortened, so that from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none;
<br><font size="-1">30</font> and those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess;
<br><font size="-1">31</font> and those who use the world, as though they did not make full use of it; for the form of this world is passing away.
<br><font size="-1"><b>32</b></font> But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;
<br><font size="-1">33</font> but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife,
<br><font size="-1">34</font> and <i>his interests</i> are divided. The woman who is unmarried, and the virgin, is concerned about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
<br><font size="-1">35</font> This I say for your own benefit; not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is appropriate and <i>to secure</i> undistracted devotion to the Lord.
<br><font size="-1"><b>36</b></font> But if any man thinks that he is acting unbecomingly toward his virgin <i>daughter,</i> if she is past her youth, and if it must be so, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin; let her marry.
<br><font size="-1">37</font> But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no constraint, but has authority over his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin <i>daughter,</i> he will do well.
<br><font size="-1">38</font> So then both he who gives his own virgin <i>daughter</i> in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage will do better.
<br><font size="-1"><b>39</b></font> A wife is bound as long as her husband lives; but if her husband is dead, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">40</font> But in my opinion she is happier if she remains as she is; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4610s"></a>Take Care with Your Liberty</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> If anyone supposes that he knows anything, he has not yet known as he ought to know;
<br><font size="-1">3</font> but if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that there is no such thing as an idol in the world, and that there is no God but one.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For even if there are so-called gods whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> yet for us there is <i>but</i> one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we <i>exist</i> for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we <i>exist</i> through Him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> However not all men have this knowledge; but some, being accustomed to the idol until now, eat <i>food</i> as if it were sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> But food will not commend us to God; we are neither the worse if we do not eat, nor the better if we do eat.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an idol''s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be strengthened to eat things sacrificed to idols?
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For through your knowledge he who is weak is ruined, the brother for whose sake Christ died.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> And so, by sinning against the brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause my brother to stumble.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4611s"></a>Paul''s Use of Liberty</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
<br><font size="-1">2</font> If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> My defense to those who examine me is this:
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Do we not have a right to eat and drink?
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife, even as the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?
<br><font size="-1">6</font> Or do only Barnabas and I not have a right to refrain from working?
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Who at any time serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat the fruit of it? Or who tends a flock and does not use the milk of the flock?
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> I am not speaking these things according to human judgment, am I? Or does not the Law also say these things?
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For it is written in the Law of Moses, "Y<font size="-1">OU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE HE IS THRESHING</font>." God is not concerned about oxen, is He?
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Or is He speaking altogether for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher <i>to thresh</i> in hope of sharing <i>the crops.</i>
<br><font size="-1">11</font> If we sowed spiritual things in you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?
<br><font size="-1">12</font> If others share the right over you, do we not more? Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we endure all things so that we will cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Do you not know that those who perform sacred services eat the <i>food</i> of the temple, <i>and</i> those who attend regularly to the altar have their share from the altar?
<br><font size="-1">14</font> So also the Lord directed those who proclaim the gospel to get their living from the gospel.
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> But I have used none of these things. And I am not writing these things so that it will be done so in my case; for it would be better for me to die than have any man make my boast an empty one.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for I am under compulsion; for woe is me if I do not preach the gospel.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if against my will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may offer the gospel without charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.
<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> For though I am free from all <i>men,</i> I have made myself a slave to all, so that I may win more.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> To the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might win Jews; to those who are under the Law, as under the Law though not being myself under the Law, so that I might win those who are under the Law;
<br><font size="-1">21</font> to those who are without law, as without law, though not being without the law of God but under the law of Christ, so that I might win those who are without law.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak; I have become all things to all men, so that I may by all means save some.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> I do all things for the sake of the gospel, so that I may become a fellow partaker of it.
<br><font size="-1"><b>24</b></font> Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but <i>only</i> one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They then <i>do it</i> to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> Therefore I run in such a way, as not without aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air;
<br><font size="-1">27</font> but I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4612s"></a>Avoid Israel''s Mistakes</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> For I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea;
<br><font size="-1">2</font> and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
<br><font size="-1">3</font> and all ate the same spiritual food;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Nevertheless, with most of them God was not well-pleased; for they were laid low in the wilderness.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they also craved.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written, "T<font size="-1">HE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK</font>, <font size="-1">AND STOOD UP TO</font> <font size="-1">PLAY</font>."
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Nor let us act immorally, as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Nor let us try the Lord, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the serpents.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Nor grumble, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed that he does not fall.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> I speak as to wise men; you judge what I say.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of Christ?
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one bread.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Look at the nation Israel; are not those who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar?
<br><font size="-1">19</font> What do I mean then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
<br><font size="-1">20</font> <i>No,</i> but <i>I say</i> that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become sharers in demons.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than He, are we?
<br><font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful, but not all things edify.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> Let no one seek his own <i>good,</i> but that of his neighbor.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without asking questions for conscience'' sake;

<br><font size="-1">27</font> If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go, eat anything that is set before you without asking questions for conscience'' sake.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> But if anyone says to you, "This is meat sacrificed to idols," do not eat <i>it,</i> for the sake of the one who informed <i>you,</i> and for conscience'' sake;
<br><font size="-1">29</font> I mean not your own conscience, but the other <i>man''s;</i> for why is my freedom judged by another''s conscience?
<br><font size="-1">30</font> If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered concerning that for which I give thanks?
<br><font size="-1"><b>31</b></font> Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.

<font size="-1">1</font> Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> Now I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold firmly to the traditions, just as I delivered them to you.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Every man who has <i>something</i> on his head while praying or prophesying disgraces his head.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> But every woman who has her head uncovered while praying or prophesying disgraces her head, for she is one and the same as the woman whose head is shaved.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> For if a woman does not cover her head, let her also have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, let her cover her head.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man;
<br><font size="-1">9</font> for indeed man was not created for the woman''s sake, but woman for the man''s sake.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Therefore the woman ought to have <i>a symbol of</i> authority on her head, because of the angels.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> However, in the Lord, neither is woman independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> For as the woman originates from the man, so also the man <i>has his birth</i> through the woman; and all things originate from God.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God <i>with her head</i> uncovered?
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,
<br><font size="-1">15</font> but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her for a covering.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> But if one is inclined to be contentious, we have no other practice, nor have the churches of God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> But in giving this instruction, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and in part I believe it.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may become evident among you.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord''s Supper,
<br><font size="-1">21</font> for in your eating each one takes his own supper first; and one is hungry and another is drunk.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4614s"></a>The Lord''s Supper</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread;
<br><font size="-1">24</font> and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, <font color="red">"This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me."</font>
<br><font size="-1">25</font> In the same way <i>He took</i> the cup also after supper, saying, <font color="red">"This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink <i>it,</i> in remembrance of Me."</font>
<br><font size="-1">26</font> For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord''s death until He comes.
<br><font size="-1"><b>27</b></font> Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not judge the body rightly.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.
<br><font size="-1"><b>33</b></font> So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment. The remaining matters I will arrange when I come.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4615s"></a>The Use of Spiritual Gifts</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now concerning spiritual <i>gifts,</i> brethren, I do not want you to be unaware.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> You know that when you were pagans, <i>you were</i> led astray to the mute idols, however you were led.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus is accursed"; and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> There are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all <i>persons.</i>
<br><font size="-1">7</font> But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit;
<br><font size="-1">9</font> to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another <i>various</i> kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> For even as the body is one and <i>yet</i> has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> For the body is not one member, but many.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> If the foot says, "Because I am not a hand, I am not <i>a part</i> of the body," it is not for this reason any the less <i>a part</i> of the body.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> And if the ear says, "Because I am not an eye, I am not <i>a part</i> of the body," it is not for this reason any the less <i>a part</i> of the body.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?
<br><font size="-1">18</font> But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> If they were all one member, where would the body be?
<br><font size="-1">20</font> But now there are many members, but one body.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> And the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you"; or again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you."
<br><font size="-1">22</font> On the contrary, it is much truer that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary;
<br><font size="-1">23</font> and those <i>members</i> of the body which we deem less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor, and our less presentable members become much more presentable,
<br><font size="-1">24</font> whereas our more presentable members have no need <i>of it.</i> But God has <i>so</i> composed the body, giving more abundant honor to that <i>member</i> which lacked,
<br><font size="-1">25</font> so that there may be no division in the body, but <i>that</i> the members may have the same care for one another.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if <i>one</i> member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
<br><font size="-1"><b>27</b></font> Now you are Christ''s body, and individually members of it.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> And God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, <i>various</i> kinds of tongues.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> All are not apostles, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All are not <i>workers of</i> miracles, are they?
<br><font size="-1">30</font> All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not speak with tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they?
<br><font size="-1">31</font> But earnestly desire the greater gifts.
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> And I show you a still more excellent way.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4616s"></a>The Excellence of Love</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> If I have <i>the gift of</i> prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> And if I give all my possessions to feed <i>the poor,</i> and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> Love is patient, love is kind <i>and</i> is not jealous; love does not brag <i>and</i> is not arrogant,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong <i>suffered,</i>
<br><font size="-1">6</font> does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> Love never fails; but if <i>there are gifts of</i> prophecy, they will be done away; if <i>there are</i> tongues, they will cease; if <i>there is</i> knowledge, it will be done away.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For we know in part and we prophesy in part;
<br><font size="-1">10</font> but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, reason like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But now faith, hope, love, abide these three; but the greatest of these is love.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4614"></a>1 CORINTHIANS: CHAPTER 14&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4617s"></a>Prophecy a Superior Gift</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Pursue love, yet desire earnestly spiritual <i>gifts,</i> but especially that you may prophesy.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God; for no one understands, but in <i>his</i> spirit he speaks mysteries.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> But one who prophesies speaks to men for edification and exhortation and consolation.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself; but one who prophesies edifies the church.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues, but <i>even</i> more that you would prophesy; and greater is one who prophesies than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may receive edifying.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you unless I speak to you either by way of revelation or of knowledge or of prophecy or of teaching?
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Yet <i>even</i> lifeless things, either flute or harp, in producing a sound, if they do not produce a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the harp?
<br><font size="-1">8</font> For if the bugle produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare himself for battle?
<br><font size="-1">9</font> So also you, unless you utter by the tongue speech that is clear, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> There are, perhaps, a great many kinds of languages in the world, and no <i>kind</i> is without meaning.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> If then I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be to the one who speaks a barbarian, and the one who speaks will be a barbarian to me.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> So also you, since you are zealous of spiritual <i>gifts,</i> seek to abound for the edification of the church.
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> What is <i>the outcome</i> then? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Otherwise if you bless in the spirit <i>only,</i> how will the one who fills the place of the ungifted say the "Amen" at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For you are giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not edified.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> I thank God, I speak in tongues more than you all;
<br><font size="-1">19</font> however, in the church I desire to speak five words with my mind so that I may instruct others also, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4618s"></a>Instruction for the Church</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>20</b></font> Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; yet in evil be infants, but in your thinking be mature.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> In the Law it is written, "B<font size="-1">Y MEN OF STRANGE TONGUES AND BY THE LIPS OF STRANGERS</font> I <font size="-1">WILL SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE</font>, <font size="-1">AND EVEN SO THEY WILL NOT LISTEN TO</font> M<font size="-1">E</font>," says the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> So then tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophecy <i>is for a sign,</i> not to unbelievers but to those who believe.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> Therefore if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues, and ungifted men or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad?
<br><font size="-1">24</font> But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an ungifted man enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all;
<br><font size="-1">25</font> the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so he will fall on his face and worship God, declaring that God is certainly among you.
<br><font size="-1"><b>26</b></font> What is <i>the outcome</i> then, brethren? When you assemble, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> If anyone speaks in a tongue, <i>it should be</i> by two or at the most three, and <i>each</i> in turn, and one must interpret;
<br><font size="-1">28</font> but if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself and to God.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others pass judgment.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> But if a revelation is made to another who is seated, the first one must keep silent.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be exhorted;
<br><font size="-1">32</font> and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets;
<br><font size="-1">33</font> for God is not <i>a God</i> of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.
<br><font size="-1"><b>34</b></font> The women are to keep silent in the churches; for they are not permitted to speak, but are to subject themselves, just as the Law also says.
<br><font size="-1">35</font> If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is improper for a woman to speak in church.
<br><font size="-1">36</font> Was it from you that the word of God <i>first</i> went forth? Or has it come to you only?
<br><font size="-1"><b>37</b></font> If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord''s commandment.
<br><font size="-1">38</font> But if anyone does not recognize <i>this,</i> he is not recognized.
<br><font size="-1"><b>39</b></font> Therefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in tongues.
<br><font size="-1">40</font> But all things must be done properly and in an orderly manner.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4615"></a>1 CORINTHIANS: CHAPTER 15&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4619s"></a>The Fact of Christ''s Resurrection</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> and last of all, as to one untimely born, He appeared to me also.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For I am the least of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Whether then <i>it was</i> I or they, so we preach and so you believed.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> Now if Christ is preached, that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has been raised;
<br><font size="-1">14</font> and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your faith also is vain.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Moreover we are even found <i>to be</i> false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised;
<br><font size="-1">17</font> and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most to be pitied.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4620s"></a>The Order of Resurrection</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>20</b></font> But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> For since by a man <i>came</i> death, by a man also <i>came</i> the resurrection of the dead.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that those who are Christ''s at His coming,
<br><font size="-1">24</font> then <i>comes</i> the end, when He hands over the kingdom to the God and Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> The last enemy that will be abolished is death.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> For H<font size="-1">E HAS PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER</font> H<font size="-1">IS FEET</font>. But when He says, "All things are put in subjection," it is evident that He is excepted who put all things in subjection to Him.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> When all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all in all.
<br><font size="-1"><b>29</b></font> Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?
<br><font size="-1">30</font> Why are we also in danger every hour?
<br><font size="-1">31</font> I affirm, brethren, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> If from human motives I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, <font size="-1">LET US EAT AND DRINK</font>, <font size="-1">FOR TOMORROW WE DIE</font>.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> Do not be deceived: "Bad company corrupts good morals."
<br><font size="-1">34</font> Become sober-minded as you ought, and stop sinning; for some have no knowledge of God. I speak <i>this</i> to your shame.
<br><font size="-1"><b>35</b></font> But someone will say, "How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?"
<br><font size="-1">36</font> You fool! That which you sow does not come to life unless it dies;
<br><font size="-1">37</font> and that which you sow, you do not sow the body which is to be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else.
<br><font size="-1">38</font> But God gives it a body just as He wished, and to each of the seeds a body of its own.
<br><font size="-1">39</font> All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one <i>flesh</i> of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish.
<br><font size="-1">40</font> There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the <i>glory</i> of the earthly is another.
<br><font size="-1">41</font> There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
<br><font size="-1"><b>42</b></font> So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a perishable <i>body,</i> it is raised an imperishable <i>body;</i>
<br><font size="-1">43</font> it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;
<br><font size="-1">44</font> it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual <i>body.</i>
<br><font size="-1">45</font> So also it is written, "The first <font size="-1">MAN</font>, Adam, <font size="-1">BECAME A LIVING SOUL</font>." The last Adam <i>became</i> a life-giving spirit.
<br><font size="-1">46</font> However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.
<br><font size="-1">47</font> The first man is from the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven.
<br><font size="-1">48</font> As is the earthy, so also are those who are earthy; and as is the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly.
<br><font size="-1">49</font> Just as we have borne the image of the earthy, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4621s"></a>The Mystery of Resurrection</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>50</b></font> Now I say this, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
<br><font size="-1">51</font> Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,
<br><font size="-1">52</font> in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.
<br><font size="-1">53</font> For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.
<br><font size="-1">54</font> But when this perishable will have put on the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come about the saying that is written, "D<font size="-1">EATH IS SWALLOWED UP</font> in victory.
<br><font size="-1">55</font> "O <font size="-1">DEATH</font>, <font size="-1">WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY</font>? O <font size="-1"> DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING</font>?"
<br><font size="-1">56</font> The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law;
<br><font size="-1">57</font> but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>58</b></font> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not <i>in</i> vain in the Lord.

<br><font size="-1">3</font> When I arrive, whomever you may approve, I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem;

<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> To the church of God which is at Corinth with all the saints who are throughout Achaia:
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> Blessed <i>be</i> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> who comforts us in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For just as the sufferings of Christ are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> and our hope for you is firmly grounded, knowing that as you are sharers of our sufferings, so also you are <i>sharers</i> of our comfort.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> For we do not want you to be unaware, brethren, of our affliction which came <i>to us</i> in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life;
<br><font size="-1">9</font> indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves so that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead;
<br><font size="-1">10</font> who delivered us from so great a <i>peril of</i> death, and will deliver <i>us,</i> He on whom we have set our hope. And He will yet deliver us,
<br><font size="-1">11</font> you also joining in helping us through your prayers, so that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the favor bestowed on us through <i>the prayers</i> <i>of</i> many.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="472s"></a>Paul''s Integrity</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> For our proud confidence is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and godly sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> For we write nothing else to you than what you read and understand, and I hope you will understand until the end;
<br><font size="-1">14</font> just as you also partially did understand us, that we are your reason to be proud as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> In this confidence I intended at first to come to you, so that you might twice receive a blessing;
<br><font size="-1">16</font> that is, to pass your way into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be helped on my journey to Judea.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Therefore, I was not vacillating when I intended to do this, was I? Or what I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that with me there will be yes, yes and no, no <i>at the same time?</i>
<br><font size="-1">18</font> But as God is faithful, our word to you is not yes and no.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you by us&#151;by me and Silvanus and Timothy&#151;was not yes and no, but is yes in Him.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> For as many as are the promises of God, in Him they are yes; therefore also through Him is our Amen to the glory of God through us.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is God,
<br><font size="-1">22</font> who also sealed us and gave <i>us</i> the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.
<br><font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> But I call God as witness to my soul, that to spare you I did not come again to Corinth.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> Not that we lord it over your faith, but are workers with you for your joy; for in your faith you are standing firm.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="473s"></a>Reaffirm Your Love</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> But I determined this for my own sake, that I would not come to you in sorrow again.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For if I cause you sorrow, who then makes me glad but the one whom I made sorrowful?
<br><font size="-1">3</font> This is the very thing I wrote you, so that when I came, I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice; having confidence in you all that my joy would be <i>the joy</i> of you all.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not so that you would be made sorrowful, but that you might know the love which I have especially for you.
<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow not to me, but in some degree&#151;in order not to say too much&#151;to all of you.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> Sufficient for such a one is this punishment which <i>was inflicted</i> by the majority,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> so that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort <i>him,</i> otherwise such a one might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Wherefore I urge you to reaffirm <i>your</i> love for him.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For to this end also I wrote, so that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> But one whom you forgive anything, I <i>forgive</i> also; for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, <i>I did it</i> for your sakes in the presence of Christ,
<br><font size="-1">11</font> so that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> I had no rest for my spirit, not finding Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went on to Macedonia.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and manifests through us the sweet aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing;
<br><font size="-1">16</font> to the one an aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma from life to life. And who is adequate for these things?
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For we are not like many, peddling the word of God, but as from sincerity, but as from God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="474s"></a>Ministers of a New Covenant</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some, letters of commendation to you or from you?
<br><font size="-1">2</font> You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;
<br><font size="-1">3</font> being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> Such confidence we have through Christ toward God.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as <i>coming</i> from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> who also made us adequate <i>as</i> servants of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> But if the ministry of death, in letters engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, fading <i>as</i> it was,
<br><font size="-1">8</font> how will the ministry of the Spirit fail to be even more with glory?
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For indeed what had glory, in this case has no glory because of the glory that surpasses <i>it.</i>
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For if that which fades away <i>was</i> with glory, much more that which remains <i>is</i> in glory.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> Therefore having such a hope, we use great boldness in <i>our</i> speech,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> and <i>are</i> not like Moses, <i>who</i> used to put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel would not look intently at the end of what was fading away.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> But their minds were hardened; for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted, because it is removed in Christ.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> But to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their heart;
<br><font size="-1">16</font> but whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, <i>there</i> is liberty.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="475s"></a>Paul''s Apostolic Ministry</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we received mercy, we do not lose heart,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> but we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not walking in craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of truth commending ourselves to every man''s conscience in the sight of God.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bond-servants for Jesus'' sake.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> For God, who said, "Light shall shine out of darkness," is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the surpassing greatness of the power will be of God and not from ourselves;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> <i>we are</i> afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not despairing;
<br><font size="-1">9</font> persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;
<br><font size="-1">10</font> always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus'' sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> So death works in us, but life in you.
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> But having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, "I <font size="-1">BELIEVED</font>, <font size="-1">THEREFORE</font> I <font size="-1">SPOKE</font>," we also believe, therefore we also speak,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will present us with you.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> For all things <i>are</i> for your sakes, so that the grace which is spreading to more and more people may cause the giving of thanks to abound to the glory of God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison,
<br><font size="-1">18</font> while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="476s"></a>The Temporal and Eternal</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For indeed in this <i>house</i> we groan, longing to be clothed with our dwelling from heaven,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> inasmuch as we, having put it on, will not be found naked.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, so that what is mortal will be swallowed up by life.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave to us the Spirit as a pledge.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord&#151;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> for we walk by faith, not by sight&#151;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Therefore we also have as our ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to Him.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> We are not again commending ourselves to you but <i>are</i> giving you an occasion to be proud of us, so that you will have <i>an answer</i> for those who take pride in appearance and not in heart.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore all died;
<br><font size="-1">15</font> and He died for all, so that they who live might no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose again on their behalf.
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> Therefore from now on we recognize no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know <i>Him</i> <i>in this way</i> no longer.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Therefore if anyone is in Christ, <i>he is</i> a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Now all <i>these</i> things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation,
<br><font size="-1">19</font> namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation.
<br><font size="-1"><b>20</b></font> Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> He made Him who knew no sin <i>to be</i> sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.

<br><font size="-1">3</font> giving no cause for offense in anything, so that the ministry will not be discredited,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God, in much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> in beatings, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hunger,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love,

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> Make room for us <i>in your hearts;</i> we wronged no one, we corrupted no one, we took advantage of no one.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> I do not speak to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Great is my confidence in you; great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction.
<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> For even when we came into Macedonia our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted on every side: conflicts without, fears within.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But God, who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, as he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced even more.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> For though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it&#151;<i>for</i> I see that that letter caused you sorrow, though only for a while&#151;
<br><font size="-1">9</font> I now rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to <i>the point of</i> repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to <i>the will of</i> God, so that you might not suffer loss in anything through us.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For the sorrow that is according to <i>the will</i> <i>of</i> God produces a repentance without regret, <i>leading</i> to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For behold what earnestness this very thing, this godly sorrow, has produced in you: what vindication of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what avenging of wrong! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in the matter.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> So although I wrote to you, <i>it was</i> not for the sake of the offender nor for the sake of the one offended, but that your earnestness on our behalf might be made known to you in the sight of God.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> For this reason we have been comforted.
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> And besides our comfort, we rejoiced even much more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For if in anything I have boasted to him about you, I was not put to shame; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, so also our boasting before Titus proved to be <i>the</i> truth.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> His affection abounds all the more toward you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> I rejoice that in everything I have confidence in you.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="479s"></a>Great Generosity</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now, brethren, we <i>wish to</i> make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> that in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For I testify that according to their ability, and beyond their ability, <i>they gave</i> of their own accord,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> begging us with much urging for the favor of participation in the support of the saints,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> and <i>this,</i> not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a beginning, so he would also complete in you this gracious work as well.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> But just as you abound in everything, in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love we inspired in you, <i>see</i> that you abound in this gracious work also.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> I am not speaking <i>this</i> as a command, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity of your love also.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> I give <i>my</i> opinion in this matter, for this is to your advantage, who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do <i>this,</i> but also to desire <i>to do it.</i>
<br><font size="-1">11</font> But now finish doing it also, so that just as <i>there was</i> the readiness to desire it, so <i>there</i> <i>may be</i> also the completion of it by your ability.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> For if the readiness is present, it is acceptable according to what <i>a person</i> has, not according to what he does not have.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> For <i>this</i> is not for the ease of others <i>and</i> for your affliction, but by way of equality&#151;
<br><font size="-1">14</font> at this present time your abundance <i>being a</i> <i>supply</i> for their need, so that their abundance also may become <i>a supply</i> for your need, that there may be equality;
<br><font size="-1">15</font> as it is written, "H<font size="-1">E WHO</font> <i>gathered</i> <font size="-1">MUCH DID NOT HAVE TOO MUCH</font>, <font size="-1">AND HE WHO</font> <i>gathered</i> <font size="-1">LITTLE HAD NO LACK</font>."
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> But thanks be to God who puts the same earnestness on your behalf in the heart of Titus.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest, he has gone to you of his own accord.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> We have sent along with him the brother whose fame in <i>the things of</i> the gospel <i>has spread</i> through all the churches;
<br><font size="-1">19</font> and not only <i>this,</i> but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work, which is being administered by us for the glory of the Lord Himself, and <i>to show</i> our readiness,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> taking precaution so that no one will discredit us in our administration of this generous gift;
<br><font size="-1">21</font> for we have regard for what is honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> We have sent with them our brother, whom we have often tested and found diligent in many things, but now even more diligent because of <i>his</i> great confidence in you.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> As for Titus, <i>he is</i> my partner and fellow worker among you; as for our brethren, <i>they are</i> messengers of the churches, a glory to Christ.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> Therefore openly before the churches, show them the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="479"></a>2 CORINTHIANS: CHAPTER 9&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4710s"></a>God Gives Most</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> For it is superfluous for me to write to you about this ministry to the saints;
<br><font size="-1">2</font> for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the Macedonians, <i>namely,</i> that Achaia has been prepared since last year, and your zeal has stirred up most of them.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> But I have sent the brethren, in order that our boasting about you may not be made empty in this case, so that, as I was saying, you may be prepared;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> otherwise if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we&#151;not to speak of you&#151;will be put to shame by this confidence.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren that they would go on ahead to you and arrange beforehand your previously promised bountiful gift, so that the same would be ready as a bountiful gift and not affected by covetousness.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> Now this <i>I say,</i> he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Each one <i>must do</i> just as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed;
<br><font size="-1">9</font> as it is written, <br>"H<font size="-1">E SCATTERED ABROAD</font>, <font size="-1">HE GAVE TO THE POOR</font>, <br>H<font size="-1">IS RIGHTEOUSNESS</font> <font size="-1">ENDURES FOREVER</font>."
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness;
<br><font size="-1">11</font> you will be enriched in everything for all liberality, which through us is producing thanksgiving to God.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> For the ministry of this service is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing through many thanksgivings to God.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Because of the proof given by this ministry, they will glorify God for <i>your</i> obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> while they also, by prayer on your behalf, yearn for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4711s"></a>Paul Describes Himself</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now I, Paul, myself urge you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ&#151;I who am meek when face to face with you, but bold toward you when absent!
<br><font size="-1">2</font> I ask that when I am present I <i>need</i> not be bold with the confidence with which I propose to be courageous against some, who regard us as if we walked according to the flesh.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> <i>We are</i> destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and <i>we are</i> taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> and we are ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> You are looking at things as they are outwardly. If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ''s, let him consider this again within himself, that just as he is Christ''s, so also are we.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not be put to shame,
<br><font size="-1">9</font> for I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For they say, "His letters are weighty and strong, but his personal presence is unimpressive and his speech contemptible."
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when absent, such persons <i>we are</i> also in deed when present.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> For we are not bold to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves; but when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But we will not boast beyond <i>our</i> measure, but within the measure of the sphere which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even as far as you.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach to you, for we were the first to come even as far as you in the gospel of Christ;
<br><font size="-1">15</font> not boasting beyond <i>our</i> measure, <i>that</i> <i>is,</i> in other men''s labors, but with the hope that as your faith grows, we will be, within our sphere, enlarged even more by you,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> so as to preach the gospel even to the regions beyond you, <i>and</i> not to boast in what has been accomplished in the sphere of another.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> But <font size="-1">HE WHO BOASTS IS TO BOAST IN THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD</font>.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> For it is not he who commends himself that is approved, but he whom the Lord commends.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4712s"></a>Paul Defends His Apostleship</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness; but indeed you are bearing with me.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy; for I betrothed you to one husband, so that to Christ I might present you <i>as</i> a pure virgin.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity <i>of devotion</i> to Christ.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted, you bear <i>this</i> beautifully.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For I consider myself not in the least inferior to the most eminent apostles.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But even if I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not <i>so</i> in knowledge; in fact, in every way we have made <i>this</i> evident to you in all things.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without charge?
<br><font size="-1">8</font> I robbed other churches by taking wages <i>from</i> <i>them</i> to serve you;
<br><font size="-1">9</font> and when I was present with you and was in need, I was not a burden to anyone; for when the brethren came from Macedonia they fully supplied my need, and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, and will continue to do so.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Why? Because I do not love you? God knows <i>I do!</i>
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> But what I am doing I will continue to do, so that I may cut off opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the matter about which they are boasting.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds.
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> Again I say, let no one think me foolish; but if <i>you do,</i> receive me even as foolish, so that I also may boast a little.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> What I am saying, I am not saying as the Lord would, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Since many boast according to the flesh, I will boast also.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> For you, being <i>so</i> wise, tolerate the foolish gladly.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> For you tolerate it if anyone enslaves you, anyone devours you, anyone takes advantage of you, anyone exalts himself, anyone hits you in the face.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> To <i>my</i> shame I <i>must</i> say that we have been weak <i>by comparison.</i>
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> But in whatever respect anyone <i>else</i> is bold&#151;I speak in foolishness&#151;I am just as bold myself.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> Are they servants of Christ?&#151;I speak as if insane&#151;I more so; in far more labors, in far more imprisonments, beaten times without number, often in danger of death.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> Five times I received from the Jews thirty-nine <i>lashes.</i>
<br><font size="-1">25</font> Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the deep.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> <i>I have been</i> on frequent journeys, in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from <i>my</i> countrymen, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers on the sea, dangers among false brethren;
<br><font size="-1">27</font> <i>I have been</i> in labor and hardship, through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> Apart from <i>such</i> external things, there is the daily pressure on me <i>of</i> concern for all the churches.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led into sin without my intense concern?
<br><font size="-1"><b>30</b></font> If I have to boast, I will boast of what pertains to my weakness.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, He who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> In Damascus the ethnarch under Aretas the king was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me,
<br><font size="-1">33</font> and I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and <i>so</i> escaped his hands.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4712"></a>2 CORINTHIANS: CHAPTER 12&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4713s"></a>Paul''s Vision</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago&#151;whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows&#151;such a man was caught up to the third heaven.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> And I know how such a man&#151;whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows&#151;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which a man is not permitted to speak.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> On behalf of such a man I will boast; but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in regard to <i>my</i> weaknesses.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> For if I do wish to boast I will not be foolish, for I will be speaking the truth; but I refrain <i>from</i> <i>this,</i> so that no one will credit me with more than he sees <i>in</i> me or hears from me.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4714s"></a>A Thorn in the Flesh</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">7</font> Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me&#151;to keep me from exalting myself!
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Concerning this I implored the Lord three times that it might leave me.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> And He has said to me, <font color="red">"My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness."</font> Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ''s sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> I have become foolish; you yourselves compelled me. Actually I should have been commended by you, for in no respect was I inferior to the most eminent apostles, even though I am a nobody.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with all perseverance, by signs and wonders and miracles.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> For in what respect were you treated as inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not become a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> Here for this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I do not seek what is yours, but you; for children are not responsible to save up for <i>their</i> parents, but parents for <i>their</i> children.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?
<br><font size="-1">16</font> But be that as it may, I did not burden you myself; nevertheless, crafty fellow that I am, I took you in by deceit.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> <i>Certainly</i> I have not taken advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you, have I?
<br><font size="-1">18</font> I urged Titus <i>to go,</i> and I sent the brother with him. Titus did not take any advantage of you, did he? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit <i>and walk</i> in the same steps?
<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> All this time you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you. <i>Actually,</i> it is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ; and all for your upbuilding, beloved.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> For I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you to be not what I wish and may be found by you to be not what you wish; that perhaps <i>there will be</i> strife, jealousy, angry tempers, disputes, slanders, gossip, arrogance, disturbances;
<br><font size="-1">21</font> I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you, and I may mourn over many of those who have sinned in the past and not repented of the impurity, immorality and sensuality which they have practiced.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="4713"></a>2 CORINTHIANS: CHAPTER 13&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4715s"></a>Examine Yourselves</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> This is the third time I am coming to you. E<font size="-1">VERY</font> <font size="-1">FACT</font> <font size="-1">IS TO BE CONFIRMED BY THE</font> <font size="-1">TESTIMONY OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES</font>.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> I have previously said when present the second time, and though now absent I say in advance to those who have sinned in the past and to all the rest <i>as well,</i> that if I come again I will not spare <i>anyone,</i>
<br><font size="-1">3</font> since you are seeking for proof of the Christ who speaks in me, and who is not weak toward you, but mighty in you.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For indeed He was crucified because of weakness, yet He lives because of the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, yet we will live with Him because of the power of God <i>directed</i> toward you.
<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> Test yourselves <i>to see</i> if you are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you&#151;unless indeed you fail the test?
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But I trust that you will realize that we ourselves do not fail the test.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Now we pray to God that you do no wrong; not that we ourselves may appear approved, but that you may do what is right, even though we may appear unapproved.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> For we can do nothing against the truth, but <i>only</i> for the truth.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For we rejoice when we ourselves are weak but you are strong; this we also pray for, that you be made complete.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For this reason I am writing these things while absent, so that when present I <i>need</i> not use severity, in accordance with the authority which the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> Finally, brethren, rejoice, be made complete, be comforted, be like-minded, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Greet one another with a holy kiss.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> All the saints greet you.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="481"></a>GALATIANS: CHAPTER 1&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="481s"></a>Introduction</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Paul, an apostle (not <i>sent</i> from men nor through the agency of man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead),
<br><font size="-1">2</font> and all the brethren who are with me,
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> To the churches of Galatia:
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> who gave Himself for our sins so that He might rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> to whom <i>be</i> the glory forevermore. Amen.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="482s"></a>Perversion of the Gospel</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> which is <i>really</i> not another; only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed!
<br><font size="-1">9</font> As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed!
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a bond-servant of Christ.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="483s"></a>Paul Defends His Ministry</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but <i>I received it</i> through a revelation of Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it;
<br><font size="-1">14</font> and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> But when God, who had set me apart <i>even</i> from my mother''s womb and called me through His grace, was pleased
<br><font size="-1">16</font> to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,
<br><font size="-1">17</font> nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went away to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus.
<br><font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and stayed with him fifteen days.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> But I did not see any other of the apostles except James, the Lord''s brother.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> (Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.)
<br><font size="-1">21</font> Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> I was <i>still</i> unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which were in Christ;
<br><font size="-1">23</font> but only, they kept hearing, "He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith which he once tried to destroy."
<br><font size="-1">24</font> And they were glorifying God because of me.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="482"></a>GALATIANS: CHAPTER 2&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="484s"></a>The Council at Jerusalem</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Then after an interval of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> It was because of a revelation that I went up; and I submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but <i>I did so</i> in private to those who were of reputation, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> But not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> But <i>it was</i> because of the false brethren secretly brought in, who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> But we did not yield in subjection to them for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But from those who were of high reputation (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)&#151;well, those who were of reputation contributed nothing to me.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> But on the contrary, seeing that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter <i>had been</i> to the circumcised
<br><font size="-1">8</font> (for He who effectually worked for Peter in <i>his</i> apostleship to the circumcised effectually worked for me also to the Gentiles),
<br><font size="-1">9</font> and recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we <i>might</i> <i>go</i> to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> <i>They</i> only <i>asked</i> us to remember the poor&#151;the very thing I also was eager to do.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="485s"></a>Peter (Cephas) Opposed by Paul</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> For prior to the coming of certain men from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he <i>began</i> to withdraw and hold himself aloof, fearing the party of the circumcision.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of all, "If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how <i>is it that</i> you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> "We <i>are</i> Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles;
<br><font size="-1">16</font> nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> "But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have also been found sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? May it never be!
<br><font size="-1">18</font> "For if I rebuild what I have <i>once</i> destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> "For through the Law I died to the Law, so that I might live to God.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> "I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the <i>life</i> which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> "I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness <i>comes</i> through the Law, then Christ died needlessly."
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="483"></a>GALATIANS: CHAPTER 3&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="486s"></a>Faith Brings Righteousness</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed <i>as</i> crucified?
<br><font size="-1">2</font> This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Did you suffer so many things in vain&#151;if indeed it was in vain?
<br><font size="-1">5</font> So then, does He who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you, do it by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> Even so Abraham <font size="-1">BELIEVED</font> G<font size="-1">OD</font>, <font size="-1">AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS</font>.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, <i>saying,</i> "A<font size="-1">LL THE NATIONS WILL BE BLESSED IN</font> <font size="-1">YOU</font><font size="-1">.</font>"
<br><font size="-1">9</font> So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer.
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse; for it is written, "C<font size="-1">URSED IS EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT ABIDE BY ALL THINGS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW</font>, <font size="-1">TO PERFORM THEM</font>."
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, "T<font size="-1">HE RIGHTEOUS MAN SHALL LIVE BY FAITH</font>."
<br><font size="-1">12</font> However, the Law is not of faith; on the contrary, "H<font size="-1">E WHO PRACTICES THEM SHALL LIVE</font> <font size="-1">BY THEM</font>."
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us&#151;for it is written, "C<font size="-1">URSED IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON</font> <font size="-1">A</font> <font size="-1">TREE</font>"&#151;
<br><font size="-1">14</font> in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="487s"></a>Intent of the Law</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> Brethren, I speak in terms of human relations: even though it is <i>only</i> a man''s covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside or adds conditions to it.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, "And to seeds," as <i>referring</i> to many, but <i>rather</i> to one, "And to your seed," that is, Christ.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> What I am saying is this: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> For if the inheritance is based on law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by means of a promise.
<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, having been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator, until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> Now a mediator is not for one <i>party only;</i> whereas God is <i>only</i> one.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given which was able to impart life, then righteousness would indeed have been based on law.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
<br><font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> Therefore the Law has become our tutor <i>to lead us</i> to Christ, so that we may be justified by faith.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham''s descendants, heirs according to promise.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="484"></a>GALATIANS: CHAPTER 4&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="488s"></a>Sonship in Christ</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he does not differ at all from a slave although he is owner of everything,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by the father.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> So also we, while we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental things of the world.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> so that He might redeem those who were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba! Father!"
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Therefore you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> However at that time, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things, to which you desire to be enslaved all over again?
<br><font size="-1">10</font> You observe days and months and seasons and years.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> I beg of you, brethren, become as I <i>am,</i> for I also <i>have become</i> as you <i>are.</i> You have done me no wrong;
<br><font size="-1">13</font> but you know that it was because of a bodily illness that I preached the gospel to you the first time;
<br><font size="-1">14</font> and that which was a trial to you in my bodily condition you did not despise or loathe, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus <i>Himself.</i>
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Where then is that sense of blessing you had? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?
<br><font size="-1">17</font> They eagerly seek you, not commendably, but they wish to shut you out so that you will seek them.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> But it is good always to be eagerly sought in a commendable manner, and not only when I am present with you.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you&#151;
<br><font size="-1">20</font> but I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="489s"></a>Bond and Free</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>21</b></font> Tell me, you who want to be under law, do you not listen to the law?
<br><font size="-1">22</font> For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondwoman and one by the free woman.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> But the son by the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> This is allegorically speaking, for these <i>women</i> are two covenants: one <i>proceeding</i> from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> But the Jerusalem above is free; she is our mother.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> For it is written, <br>"R<font size="-1">EJOICE</font>, <font size="-1">BARREN WOMAN WHO DOES NOT BEAR</font>; <br>B<font size="-1">REAK FORTH AND SHOUT</font>, <font size="-1">YOU WHO ARE NOT IN LABOR</font>; <br>F<font size="-1">OR MORE NUMEROUS ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE DESOLATE</font> <br>T<font size="-1">HAN OF THE ONE WHO HAS A HUSBAND</font>."
<br><font size="-1">28</font> And you brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him <i>who was born</i> according to the Spirit, so it is now also.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> But what does the Scripture say? <br>"C<font size="-1">AST OUT THE BONDWOMAN AND HER SON</font>, <br>F<font size="-1">OR</font> <font size="-1">THE SON OF THE BONDWOMAN SHALL NOT BE AN HEIR WITH THE SON OF THE FREE WOMAN</font>."
<br><font size="-1">31</font> So then, brethren, we are not children of a bondwoman, but of the free woman.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="485"></a>GALATIANS: CHAPTER 5&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4810s"></a>Walk by the Spirit</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For we through the Spirit, by faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?
<br><font size="-1">8</font> This persuasion <i>did</i> not <i>come</i> from Him who calls you.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> A little leaven leavens the whole lump <i>of dough.</i>
<br><font size="-1">10</font> I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt no other view; but the one who is disturbing you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> I wish that those who are troubling you would even mutilate themselves.
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> For you were called to freedom, brethren; only <i>do</i> not <i>turn</i> your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the <i>statement,</i> "Y<font size="-1">OU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF</font>."
<br><font size="-1">15</font> But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,
<br><font size="-1">21</font> envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
<br><font size="-1">23</font> gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
<br><font size="-1"><b>25</b></font> If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one another.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="4811s"></a>Bear One Another''s Burdens</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; <i>each one</i> looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Bear one another''s burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> But each one must examine his own work, and then he will have <i>reason for</i> boasting in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to another.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For each one will bear his own load.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> The one who is taught the word is to share all good things with the one who teaches <i>him.</i>
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> So then, while we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who are of the household of the faith.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Those who desire to make a good showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised, simply so that they will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> For those who are circumcised do not even keep the Law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> But may it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> And those who will walk by this rule, peace and mercy <i>be</i> upon them, and upon the Israel of God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> From now on let no one cause trouble for me, for I bear on my body the brand-marks of Jesus.
<br><font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="491s"></a>The Blessings of Redemption</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> To the saints who are at Ephesus and <i>who are</i> faithful in Christ Jesus:
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> Blessed <i>be</i> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly <i>places</i> in Christ,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love
<br><font size="-1">5</font> He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace
<br><font size="-1">8</font> which He lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight
<br><font size="-1">9</font> He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His kind intention which He purposed in Him
<br><font size="-1">10</font> with a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of the times, <i>that is,</i> the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth. In Him
<br><font size="-1">11</font> also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will,
<br><font size="-1">12</font> to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of His glory.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation&#151;having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of <i>God''s own</i> possession, to the praise of His glory.
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which <i>exists</i> among you and your love for all the saints,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention <i>of you</i> in my prayers;
<br><font size="-1">17</font> that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> <i>I pray that</i> the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,
<br><font size="-1">19</font> and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. <i>These are</i> in accordance with the working of the strength of His might
<br><font size="-1">20</font> which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly <i>places,</i>
<br><font size="-1">21</font> far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church,
<br><font size="-1">23</font> which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="492s"></a>Made Alive in Christ</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),
<br><font size="-1">6</font> and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly <i>places</i> in Christ Jesus,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, <i>it is</i> the gift of God;
<br><font size="-1">9</font> not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called "Uncircumcision" by the so-called "Circumcision," <i>which is</i> performed in the flesh by human hands&#151;
<br><font size="-1">12</font> <i>remember</i> that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For He Himself is our peace, who made both <i>groups into</i> one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,
<br><font size="-1">15</font> by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, <i>which is</i> the Law of commandments <i>contained</i> in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, <i>thus</i> establishing peace,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> A<font size="-1">ND</font> H<font size="-1">E CAME AND PREACHED</font> <font size="-1">PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE</font> <font size="-1">FAR AWAY</font>, <font size="-1">AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE</font> <font size="-1">NEAR</font>;
<br><font size="-1">18</font> for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God''s household,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner <i>stone,</i>
<br><font size="-1">21</font> in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord,

<font size="-1">1</font> For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles&#151;
<br><font size="-1">2</font> if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God''s grace which was given to me for you;
<br><font size="-1">3</font> that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;
<br><font size="-1">6</font> <i>to be specific,</i> that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God''s grace which was given to me according to the working of His power.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ,
<br><font size="-1">9</font> and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things;
<br><font size="-1">10</font> so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly <i>places.</i>
<br><font size="-1">11</font> <i>This was</i> in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,
<br><font size="-1">12</font> in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf, for they are your glory.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,
<br><font size="-1">15</font> from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man,

<br><font size="-1">18</font> may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
<br><font size="-1">19</font> and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>20</b></font> Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,
<br><font size="-1">21</font> to Him <i>be</i> the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="494s"></a>Unity of the Spirit</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> <i>There is</i> one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling;
<br><font size="-1">5</font> one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ''s gift.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Therefore it says, <br>"W<font size="-1">HEN</font> H<font size="-1">E ASCENDED ON HIGH</font>, <br>H<font size="-1">E</font> <font size="-1">LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND</font> H<font size="-1">E GAVE GIFTS TO MEN</font>."
<br><font size="-1">9</font> (Now this <i>expression,</i> "He ascended," what does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth?
<br><font size="-1">10</font> He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.)
<br><font size="-1">11</font> And He gave some <i>as</i> apostles, and some <i>as</i> prophets, and some <i>as</i> evangelists, and some <i>as</i> pastors and teachers,
<br><font size="-1">12</font> for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ;
<br><font size="-1">13</font> until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming;
<br><font size="-1">15</font> but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all <i>aspects</i> into Him who is the head, <i>even</i> Christ,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="495s"></a>The Christian''s Walk</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,
<br><font size="-1">18</font> being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;
<br><font size="-1">19</font> and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> But you did not learn Christ in this way,
<br><font size="-1">21</font> if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus,
<br><font size="-1">22</font> that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit,
<br><font size="-1">23</font> and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
<br><font size="-1">24</font> and put on the new self, which in <i>the likeness of</i> God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.
<br><font size="-1"><b>25</b></font> Therefore, laying aside falsehood, <font size="-1">SPEAK TRUTH EACH ONE</font> <i>of you</i> <font size="-1">WITH HIS NEIGHBOR</font>, for we are members of one another.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> B<font size="-1">E ANGRY</font>, <font size="-1">AND</font> <i>yet</i> <font size="-1">DO NOT SIN</font>; do not let the sun go down on your anger,
<br><font size="-1">27</font> and do not give the devil an opportunity.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> He who steals must steal no longer; but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have <i>something</i> to share with one who has need.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such <i>a word</i> as is good for edification according to the need <i>of the moment,</i> so that it will give grace to those who hear.
<br><font size="-1">30</font> Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="496s"></a>Be Imitators of God</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children;
<br><font size="-1">2</font> and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> and <i>there must be no</i> filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Therefore do not be partakers with them;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light
<br><font size="-1">9</font> (for the fruit of the Light <i>consists</i> in all goodness and righteousness and truth),
<br><font size="-1">10</font> trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them;
<br><font size="-1">12</font> for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For this reason it says, <br>"Awake, sleeper, <br>And arise from the dead, <br>And Christ will shine on you."
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> making the most of your time, because the days are evil.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,
<br><font size="-1">19</font> speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;
<br><font size="-1">20</font> always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;
<br><font size="-1">21</font> and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="497s"></a>Marriage Like Christ and the Church</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> Wives, <i>be subject</i> to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself <i>being</i> the Savior of the body.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives <i>ought to be</i> to their husbands in everything.
<br><font size="-1"><b>25</b></font> Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,
<br><font size="-1">26</font> so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,
<br><font size="-1">27</font> that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself;
<br><font size="-1">29</font> for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also <i>does</i> the church,
<br><font size="-1">30</font> because we are members of His body.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> F<font size="-1">OR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND SHALL BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE</font>, <font size="-1">AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH</font>.
<br><font size="-1">32</font> This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
<br><font size="-1">33</font> Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and the wife must <i>see to it</i> that she respects her husband.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="501s"></a>Thanksgiving</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus,
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons:
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> in view of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> <i>For I am</i> confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> so that you may approve the things that are excellent, in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ;
<br><font size="-1">11</font> having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which <i>comes</i> through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="502s"></a>The Gospel Is Preached</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> Now I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> so that my imprisonment in <i>the cause of</i> Christ has become well known throughout the whole praetorian guard and to everyone else,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> and that most of the brethren, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, have far more courage to speak the word of God without fear.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ even from envy and strife, but some also from good will;
<br><font size="-1">16</font> the latter <i>do it</i> out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel;
<br><font size="-1">17</font> the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition rather than from pure motives, thinking to cause me distress in my imprisonment.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice.
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> Yes, and I will rejoice,
<br><font size="-1">19</font> for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will not be put to shame in anything, but <i>that</i> with all boldness, Christ will even now, as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="503s"></a>To Live Is Christ</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">21</font> For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> But if <i>I am</i> to live <i>on</i> in the flesh, this <i>will mean</i> fruitful labor for me; and I do not know which to choose.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> But I am hard-pressed from both <i>directions,</i> having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for <i>that</i> is very much better;
<br><font size="-1">24</font> yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith,
<br><font size="-1">26</font> so that your proud confidence in me may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again.
<br><font size="-1"><b>27</b></font> Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I will hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
<br><font size="-1">28</font> in no way alarmed by <i>your</i> opponents&#151;which is a sign of destruction for them, but of salvation for you, and that <i>too,</i> from God.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> For to you it has been granted for Christ''s sake, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,
<br><font size="-1">30</font> experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear <i>to be</i> in me.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="502"></a>PHILIPPIANS: CHAPTER 2&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="504s"></a>Be Like Christ</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> do not <i>merely</i> look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, <i>and</i> being made in the likeness of men.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> so that at the name of Jesus <font size="-1">EVERY KNEE WILL BOW,</font> of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
<br><font size="-1">11</font> and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling;
<br><font size="-1">13</font> for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for <i>His</i> good pleasure.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> Do all things without grumbling or disputing;
<br><font size="-1">15</font> so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> You too, <i>I urge you,</i> rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="505s"></a>Timothy and Epaphroditus</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> For I have no one <i>else</i> of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> But you know of his proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child <i>serving</i> his father.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> Therefore I hope to send him immediately, as soon as I see how things <i>go</i> with me;
<br><font size="-1">24</font> and I trust in the Lord that I myself also will be coming shortly.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need;
<br><font size="-1">26</font> because he was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> For indeed he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned <i>about you.</i>
<br><font size="-1">29</font> Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold men like him in high regard;
<br><font size="-1">30</font> because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="506s"></a>The Goal of Life</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things <i>again</i> is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you.
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision;
<br><font size="-1">3</font> for we are the <i>true</i> circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> although I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If anyone else has a mind to put confidence in the flesh, I far more:
<br><font size="-1">5</font> circumcised the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the Law, a Pharisee;
<br><font size="-1">6</font> as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to the righteousness which is in the Law, found blameless.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> But whatever things were gain to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ,
<br><font size="-1">9</font> and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from <i>the</i> Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which <i>comes</i> from God on the basis of faith,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death;
<br><font size="-1">11</font> in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> Not that I have already obtained <i>it</i> or have already become perfect, but I press on so that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of <i>it</i> yet; but one thing <i>I do:</i> forgetting what <i>lies</i> behind and reaching forward to what <i>lies</i> ahead,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you;
<br><font size="-1">16</font> however, let us keep living by that same <i> standard</i> to which we have attained.
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> Brethren, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> For many walk, of whom I often told you, and now tell you even weeping, <i>that they are</i> enemies of the cross of Christ,
<br><font size="-1">19</font> whose end is destruction, whose god is <i>their</i> appetite, and <i>whose</i> glory is in their shame, who set their minds on earthly things.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;
<br><font size="-1">21</font> who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore, my beloved brethren whom I long <i>to see,</i> my joy and crown, in this way stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.

<br><font size="-1">3</font> Indeed, true companion, I ask you also to help these women who have shared my struggle in <i>the cause of</i> the gospel, together with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice!
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Let your gentle <i>spirit</i> be known to all men. The Lord is near.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.

<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="508s"></a>God''s Provisions</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at last you have revived your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned <i>before,</i> but you lacked opportunity.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need.

<br><font size="-1">16</font> for even in Thessalonica you sent <i>a gift</i> more than once for my needs.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit which increases to your account.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> But I have received everything in full and have an abundance; I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you have sent, a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.

<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ <i>who are</i> at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the saints;
<br><font size="-1">5</font> because of the hope laid up for you in heaven, of which you previously heard in the word of truth, the gospel
<br><font size="-1">6</font> which has come to you, just as in all the world also it is constantly bearing fruit and increasing, even as <i>it has been doing</i> in you also since the day you heard <i>of it</i> and understood the grace of God in truth;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> just as you learned <i>it</i> from Epaphras, our beloved fellow bond-servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,
<br><font size="-1">8</font> and he also informed us of your love in the Spirit.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> For this reason also, since the day we heard <i>of it,</i> we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please <i>Him</i> in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;
<br><font size="-1">11</font> strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might, for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience; joyously
<br><font size="-1">12</font> giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in Light.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="512s"></a>The Incomparable Christ</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">13</font> For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> For by Him all things were created, <i>both</i> in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities&#151;all things have been created through Him and for Him.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> For it was the <i>Father''s</i> good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, <i>I say,</i> whether things on earth or things in heaven.
<br><font size="-1"><b>21</b></font> And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, <i>engaged</i> in evil deeds,
<br><font size="-1">22</font> yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond reproach&#151;
<br><font size="-1">23</font> if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made a minister.
<br><font size="-1"><b>24</b></font> Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of His body, which is the church, in filling up what is lacking in Christ''s afflictions.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> Of <i>this church</i> I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out the <i>preaching of</i> the word of God,
<br><font size="-1">26</font> <i>that is,</i> the mystery which has been hidden from the <i>past</i> ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints,
<br><font size="-1">27</font> to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> We proclaim Him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, so that we may present every man complete in Christ.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> For this purpose also I labor, striving according to His power, which mightily works within me.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="513s"></a>You Are Built Up in Christ</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf and for those who are at Laodicea, and for all those who have not personally seen my face,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> that their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and <i>attaining</i> to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, <i>resulting</i> in a true knowledge of God''s mystery, <i>that is,</i> Christ <i>Himself,</i>
<br><font size="-1">3</font> in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> I say this so that no one will delude you with persuasive argument.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For even though I am absent in body, nevertheless I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good discipline and the stability of your faith in Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, <i>so</i> walk in Him,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> having been firmly rooted <i>and now</i> being built up in Him and established in your faith, just as you were instructed, <i>and</i> overflowing with gratitude.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over all rule and authority;
<br><font size="-1">11</font> and in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ;
<br><font size="-1">12</font> having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day&#151;
<br><font size="-1">17</font> things which are a <i>mere</i> shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on <i>visions</i> he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind,
<br><font size="-1">19</font> and not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>20</b></font> If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as,
<br><font size="-1">21</font> "Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!"
<br><font size="-1">22</font> (which all <i>refer to</i> things destined to perish with use)&#151;in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men?
<br><font size="-1">23</font> These are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, <i>but are</i> of no value against fleshly indulgence.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="513"></a>COLOSSIANS: CHAPTER 3&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="514s"></a>Put On the New Self</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.
<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which amounts to idolatry.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> For it is because of these things that the wrath of God will come upon the sons of disobedience,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> and in them you also once walked, when you were living in them.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> But now you also, put them all aside: anger, wrath, malice, slander, <i>and</i> abusive speech from your mouth.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Do not lie to one another, since you laid aside the old self with its <i>evil</i> practices,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> and have put on the new self who is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created him&#151;
<br><font size="-1">11</font> <i>a renewal</i> in which there is no <i>distinction between</i> Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman, but Christ is all, and in all.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience;
<br><font size="-1">13</font> bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Beyond all these things <i>put on</i> love, which is the perfect bond of unity.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body; and be thankful.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms <i>and</i> hymns <i>and</i> spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Whatever you do in word or deed, <i>do</i> all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="515s"></a>Family Relations</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> Children, be obedient to your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so that they will not lose heart.
<br><font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> Slaves, in all things obey those who are your masters on earth, not with external service, as those who <i>merely</i> please men, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men,
<br><font size="-1">24</font> knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> For he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done, and that without partiality.

<font size="-1">1</font> Masters, grant to your slaves justice and fairness, knowing that you too have a Master in heaven.
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with <i>an attitude of</i> thanksgiving;
<br><font size="-1">3</font> praying at the same time for us as well, that God will open up to us a door for the word, so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ, for which I have also been imprisoned;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak.
<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> Let your speech always be with grace, <i>as though</i> seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> As to all my affairs, Tychicus, <i>our</i> beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow bond-servant in the Lord, will bring you information.

<br><font size="-1">12</font> Epaphras, who is one of your number, a bondslave of Jesus Christ, sends you his greetings, always laboring earnestly for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> For I testify for him that he has a deep concern for you and for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="521s"></a>Thanksgiving for These Believers</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Paul and Silvanus and Timothy,
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention <i>of you</i> in our prayers;
<br><font size="-1">3</font> constantly bearing in mind your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> knowing, brethren beloved by God, <i>His</i> choice of you;
<br><font size="-1">5</font> for our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction; just as you know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> You also became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth, so that we have no need to say anything.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, <i>that is</i> Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="522"></a>1 THESSALONIANS: CHAPTER 2&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="522s"></a>Paul''s Ministry</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming to you was not in vain,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> but after we had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi, as you know, we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much opposition.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For our exhortation does not <i>come</i> from error or impurity or by way of deceit;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who examines our hearts.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For we never came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed&#151;God is witness&#151;
<br><font size="-1">6</font> nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, even though as apostles of Christ we might have asserted our authority.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> But we proved to be gentle among you, as a nursing <i>mother</i> tenderly cares for her own children.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Having so fond an affection for you, we were well-pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> For you recall, brethren, our labor and hardship, <i>how</i> working night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> You are witnesses, and <i>so is</i> God, how devoutly and uprightly and blamelessly we behaved toward you believers;
<br><font size="-1">11</font> just as you know how we <i>were</i> exhorting and encouraging and imploring each one of you as a father <i>would</i> his own children,
<br><font size="-1">12</font> so that you would walk in a manner worthy of the God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> For this reason we also constantly thank God that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted <i>it</i> not <i>as</i> the word of men, but <i>for</i> what it really is, the word of God, which also performs its work in you who believe.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen, even as they <i>did</i> from the Jews,
<br><font size="-1">15</font> who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out. They are not pleasing to God, but hostile to all men,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved; with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them to the utmost.
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short while&#151;in person, not in spirit&#151;were all the more eager with great desire to see your face.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> For we wanted to come to you&#151;I, Paul, more than once&#151;and <i>yet</i> Satan hindered us.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> For who is our hope or joy or crown of exultation? Is it not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming?
<br><font size="-1">20</font> For you are our glory and joy.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="523s"></a>Encouragement of Timothy''s Visit</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore when we could endure <i>it</i> no longer, we thought it best to be left behind at Athens alone,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> and we sent Timothy, our brother and God''s fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you as to your faith,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> so that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we have been destined for this.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For indeed when we were with you, we <i>kept</i> telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction; and so it came to pass, as you know.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For this reason, when I could endure <i>it</i> no longer, I also sent to find out about your faith, for fear that the tempter might have tempted you, and our labor would be in vain.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always think kindly of us, longing to see us just as we also long to see you,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> for this reason, brethren, in all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your faith;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> for now we <i>really</i> live, if you stand firm in the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For what thanks can we render to God for you in return for all the joy with which we rejoice before our God on your account,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> as we night and day keep praying most earnestly that we may see your face, and may complete what is lacking in your faith?
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> Now may our God and Father Himself and Jesus our Lord direct our way to you;
<br><font size="-1">12</font> and may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love for one another, and for all people, just as we also <i>do</i> for you;
<br><font size="-1">13</font> so that He may establish your hearts without blame in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="524s"></a>Sanctification and Love</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Finally then, brethren, we request and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us <i>instruction</i> as to how you ought to walk and please God (just as you actually do walk), that you excel still more.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For you know what commandments we gave you by <i>the authority of</i> the Lord Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For this is the will of God, your sanctification; <i>that is,</i> that you abstain from sexual immorality;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> not in lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God;
<br><font size="-1">6</font> <i>and</i> that no man transgress and defraud his brother in the matter because the Lord is <i>the</i> avenger in all these things, just as we also told you before and solemnly warned <i>you.</i>
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For God has not called us for the purpose of impurity, but in sanctification.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> So, he who rejects <i>this</i> is not rejecting man but the God who gives His Holy Spirit to you.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> Now as to the love of the brethren, you have no need for <i>anyone</i> to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another;
<br><font size="-1">10</font> for indeed you do practice it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, to excel still more,
<br><font size="-1">11</font> and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and attend to your own business and work with your hands, just as we commanded you,
<br><font size="-1">12</font> so that you will behave properly toward outsiders and not be in any need.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="525s"></a>Those Who Died in Christ</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of <i>the</i> archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Therefore comfort one another with these words.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="525"></a>1 THESSALONIANS: CHAPTER 5&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="526s"></a>The Day of the Lord</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now as to the times and the epochs, brethren, you have no need of anything to be written to you.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> While they are saying, "Peace and safety!" then destruction will come upon them suddenly like labor pains upon a woman with child, and they will not escape.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day would overtake you like a thief;
<br><font size="-1">5</font> for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness;
<br><font size="-1">6</font> so then let us not sleep as others do, but let us be alert and sober.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For those who sleep do their sleeping at night, and those who get drunk get drunk at night.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> But since we are of <i>the</i> day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

<br><font size="-1">14</font> We urge you, brethren, admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="531s"></a>Thanksgiving for Faith and Perseverance</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Paul and Silvanus and Timothy,
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brethren, as is <i>only</i> fitting, because your faith is greatly enlarged, and the love of each one of you toward one another grows <i>ever</i> greater;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> therefore, we ourselves speak proudly of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in the midst of all your persecutions and afflictions which you endure.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> <i>This is</i> a plain indication of God''s righteous judgment so that you will be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which indeed you are suffering.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> For after all it is <i>only</i> just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> and <i>to give</i> relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire,
<br><font size="-1">8</font> dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day, and to be marveled at among all who have believed&#151;for our testimony to you was believed.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> To this end also we pray for you always, that our God will count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire for goodness and the work of faith with power,
<br><font size="-1">12</font> so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and <i>the</i> Lord Jesus Christ.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="532s"></a>Man of Lawlessness</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now we request you, brethren, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> that you not be quickly shaken from your composure or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Let no one in any way deceive you, for <i>it will not come</i> unless the apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, displaying himself as being God.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I was telling you these things?
<br><font size="-1">6</font> And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he will be revealed.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains <i>will do so</i> until he is taken out of the way.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Then that lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord will slay with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming;
<br><font size="-1">9</font> <i>that is,</i> the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false,
<br><font size="-1">12</font> in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness.
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> It was for this He called you through our gospel, that you may gain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word <i>of mouth</i> or by letter from us.
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace,
<br><font size="-1">17</font> comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good work and word.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="533"></a>2 THESSALONIANS: CHAPTER 3&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="533s"></a>Exhortation</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord will spread rapidly and be glorified, just as <i>it did</i> also with you;
<br><font size="-1">2</font> and that we will be rescued from perverse and evil men; for not all have faith.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil <i>one.</i>
<br><font size="-1">4</font> We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will <i>continue to</i> do what we command.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness of Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother who leads an unruly life and not according to the tradition which you received from us.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example, because we did not act in an undisciplined manner among you,
<br><font size="-1">8</font> nor did we eat anyone''s bread without paying for it, but with labor and hardship we <i>kept</i> working night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you;
<br><font size="-1">9</font> not because we do not have the right <i>to this,</i> but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you, so that you would follow our example.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For even when we were with you, we used to give you this order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he is not to eat, either.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, doing no work at all, but acting like busybodies.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work in quiet fashion and eat their own bread.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary of doing good.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he will be put to shame.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> <i>Yet</i> do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance. The Lord be with you all!
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="541s"></a>Misleadings in Doctrine and Living</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus, <i>who is</i> our hope,
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> To Timothy, <i>my</i> true child in <i>the</i> faith: Grace, mercy <i>and</i> peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> As I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to mere speculation rather than <i>furthering</i> the administration of God which is by faith.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> For some men, straying from these things, have turned aside to fruitless discussion,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully,
<br><font size="-1">9</font> realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers
<br><font size="-1">10</font> and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching,
<br><font size="-1">11</font> according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, putting me into service,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor. Yet I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief;
<br><font size="-1">14</font> and the grace of our Lord was more than abundant, with the faith and love which are <i>found</i> in Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost <i>of all.</i>
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, <i>be</i> honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
<br><font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> This command I entrust to you, Timothy, <i>my</i> son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you fight the good fight,
<br><font size="-1">19</font> keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they will be taught not to blaspheme.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="542"></a>1 TIMOTHY: CHAPTER 2&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="542s"></a>A Call to Prayer</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> First of all, then, I urge that entreaties <i>and</i> prayers, petitions <i>and</i> thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For there is one God, <i>and</i> one mediator also between God and men, <i>the</i> man Christ Jesus,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony <i>given</i> at the proper time.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying) as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and dissension.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="543s"></a>Women Instructed</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">9</font> Likewise, <i>I want</i> women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> but rather by means of good works, as is proper for women making a claim to godliness.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> For it was Adam who was first created, <i>and</i> then Eve.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> And <i>it was</i> not Adam <i>who</i> was deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> But <i>women</i> will be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="543"></a>1 TIMOTHY: CHAPTER 3&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="544s"></a>Overseers and Deacons</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> It is a trustworthy statement: if any man aspires to the office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires <i>to do.</i>
<br><font size="-1">2</font> An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> not addicted to wine or pugnacious, but gentle, peaceable, free from the love of money.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> <i>He must be</i> one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity
<br><font size="-1">5</font> (but if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?),
<br><font size="-1">6</font> <i>and</i> not a new convert, so that he will not become conceited and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> And he must have a good reputation with those outside <i>the church,</i> so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> Deacons likewise <i>must be</i> men of dignity, not double-tongued, or addicted to much wine or fond of sordid gain,
<br><font size="-1">9</font> <i>but</i> holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> These men must also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Women <i>must</i> likewise <i>be</i> dignified, not malicious gossips, but temperate, faithful in all things.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Deacons must be husbands of <i>only</i> one wife, <i>and</i> good managers of <i>their</i> children and their own households.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you before long;
<br><font size="-1">15</font> but in case I am delayed, <i>I write</i> so that you will know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> By common confession, great is the mystery of godliness: <br>He who was revealed in the flesh, <br>Was vindicated in the Spirit, <br>Seen by angels, <br>Proclaimed among the nations, <br>Believed on in the world, <br>Taken up in glory.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="544"></a>1 TIMOTHY: CHAPTER 4&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="545s"></a>Apostasy</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> <i>men</i> who forbid marriage <i>and advocate</i> abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude;
<br><font size="-1">5</font> for it is sanctified by means of the word of God and prayer.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="546s"></a>A Good Minister''s Discipline</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> In pointing out these things to the brethren, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, <i>constantly</i> nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound doctrine which you have been following.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> But have nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for old women. On the other hand, discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> for bodily discipline is only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and <i>also</i> for the <i>life</i> to come.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> It is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For it is for this we labor and strive, because we have fixed our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of believers.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> Prescribe and teach these things.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but <i>rather</i> in speech, conduct, love, faith <i>and</i> purity, show yourself an example of those who believe.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Until I come, give attention to the <i>public</i> reading <i>of Scripture,</i> to exhortation and teaching.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, which was bestowed on you through prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the presbytery.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Take pains with these things; be <i>absorbed</i> in them, so that your progress will be evident to all.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching; persevere in these things, for as you do this you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="545"></a>1 TIMOTHY: CHAPTER 5&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="547s"></a>Honor Widows</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but <i>rather</i> appeal to <i>him</i> as a father, <i>to</i> the younger men as brothers,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> the older women as mothers, <i>and</i> the younger women as sisters, in all purity.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> Honor widows who are widows indeed;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> but if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to practice piety in regard to their own family and to make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Now she who is a widow indeed and who has been left alone, has fixed her hope on God and continues in entreaties and prayers night and day.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But she who gives herself to wanton pleasure is dead even while she lives.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Prescribe these things as well, so that they may be above reproach.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than sixty years old, <i>having been</i> the wife of one man,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> having a reputation for good works; <i>and</i> if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the saints'' feet, if she has assisted those in distress, <i>and</i> if she has devoted herself to every good work.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> But refuse <i>to put</i> younger widows <i>on the list,</i> for when they feel sensual desires in disregard of Christ, they want to get married,
<br><font size="-1">12</font> <i>thus</i> incurring condemnation, because they have set aside their previous pledge.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> At the same time they also learn <i>to be</i> idle, as they go around from house to house; and not merely idle, but also gossips and busybodies, talking about things not proper <i>to mention.</i>
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Therefore, I want younger <i>widows</i> to get married, bear children, keep house, <i>and</i> give the enemy no occasion for reproach;
<br><font size="-1">15</font> for some have already turned aside to follow Satan.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> If any woman who is a believer has <i>dependent</i> widows, she must assist them and the church must not be burdened, so that it may assist those who are widows indeed.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="548s"></a>Concerning Elders</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> For the Scripture says, "Y<font size="-1">OU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE HE IS THRESHING</font>," and "The laborer is worthy of his wages."
<br><font size="-1">19</font> Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> Those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest also will be fearful <i>of sinning.</i>
<br><font size="-1">21</font> I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of <i>His</i> chosen angels, to maintain these <i>principles</i> without bias, doing nothing in a <i>spirit of</i> partiality.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> Do not lay hands upon anyone <i>too</i> hastily and thereby share <i>responsibility for</i> the sins of others; keep yourself free from sin.
<br><font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> No longer drink water <i>exclusively,</i> but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.
<br><font size="-1"><b>24</b></font> The sins of some men are quite evident, going before them to judgment; for others, their <i>sins</i> follow after.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> Likewise also, deeds that are good are quite evident, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="546"></a>1 TIMOTHY: CHAPTER 6&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="549s"></a>Instructions to Those Who Minister</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and <i>our</i> doctrine will not be spoken against.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but must serve them all the more, because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach and preach these <i>principles.</i>
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree with sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine conforming to godliness,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> he is conceited <i>and</i> understands nothing; but he has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, out of which arise envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> and constant friction between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But godliness <i>actually</i> is a means of great gain when accompanied by contentment.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take anything out of it either.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> If we have food and covering, with these we shall be content.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and destruction.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> But flee from these things, you man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance <i>and</i> gentleness.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> that you keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
<br><font size="-1">15</font> which He will bring about at the proper time&#151;He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. To Him <i>be</i> honor and eternal dominion! Amen.
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy.

<br><font size="-1"><b>20</b></font> O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding worldly <i>and</i> empty chatter <i>and</i> the opposing arguments of what is falsely called "knowledge"&#151;

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="551s"></a>Timothy Charged to Guard His Trust</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> To Timothy, my beloved son: Grace, mercy <i>and</i> peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> longing to see you, even as I recall your tears, so that I may be filled with joy.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that <i>it is</i> in you as well.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner, but join with <i>me</i> in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God,
<br><font size="-1">9</font> who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> but now has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,
<br><font size="-1">11</font> for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Retain the standard of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to <i>you.</i>
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains;
<br><font size="-1">17</font> but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me&#151;
<br><font size="-1">18</font> the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day&#151;and you know very well what services he rendered at Ephesus.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="552"></a>2 TIMOTHY: CHAPTER 2&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="552s"></a>Be Strong</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> The things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Suffer hardship with <i>me,</i> as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descendant of David, according to my gospel,
<br><font size="-1">9</font> for which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal; but the word of God is not imprisoned.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For this reason I endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus <i>and</i> with <i>it</i> eternal glory.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> It is a trustworthy statement: <br>For if we died with Him, we will also live with Him;
<br><font size="-1">12</font> If we endure, we will also reign with Him; <br>If we deny Him, He also will deny us;
<br><font size="-1">13</font> If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="553s"></a>An Unashamed Workman</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> Remind <i>them</i> of these things, and solemnly charge <i>them</i> in the presence of God not to wrangle about words, which is useless <i>and leads</i> to the ruin of the hearers.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> But avoid worldly <i>and</i> empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness,
<br><font size="-1">17</font> and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
<br><font size="-1">18</font> <i>men</i> who have gone astray from the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, "The Lord knows those who are His," and, "Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness."
<br><font size="-1"><b>20</b></font> Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these <i>things,</i> he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love <i>and</i> peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce quarrels.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> The Lord''s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged,
<br><font size="-1">25</font> with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth,
<br><font size="-1">26</font> and they may come to their senses <i>and escape</i> from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="553"></a>2 TIMOTHY: CHAPTER 3&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power; Avoid such men as these.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> For among them are those who enter into households and captivate weak women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these <i>men</i> also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected in regard to the faith.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> But they will not make further progress; for their folly will be obvious to all, just as Jannes''s and Jambres''s folly was also.
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> Now you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance,
<br><font size="-1">11</font> persecutions, <i>and</i> sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium <i>and</i> at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me!
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But evil men and impostors will proceed <i>from bad</i> to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned <i>them,</i>
<br><font size="-1">15</font> and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;
<br><font size="-1">17</font> so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.

<br><font size="-1">2</font> preach the word; be ready in season <i>and</i> out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but <i>wanting</i> to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing.

<br><font size="-1">10</font> for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens <i>has gone</i> to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.

<font size="-1">1</font> Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages ago,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> but at the proper time manifested, <i>even</i> His word, in the proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior,
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> To Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="562s"></a>Qualifications of Elders</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> <i>namely,</i> if any man is above reproach, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of dissipation or rebellion.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For the overseer must be above reproach as God''s steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not fond of sordid gain,
<br><font size="-1">8</font> but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, just, devout, self-controlled,
<br><font size="-1">9</font> holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict.
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> For there are many rebellious men, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,
<br><font size="-1">11</font> who must be silenced because they are upsetting whole families, teaching things they should not <i>teach</i> for the sake of sordid gain.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."
<br><font size="-1">13</font> This testimony is true. For this reason reprove them severely so that they may be sound in the faith,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> They profess to know God, but by <i>their</i> deeds they deny <i>Him,</i> being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed.

<font size="-1">1</font> But as for you, speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Older men are to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, in perseverance.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> <i>to be</i> sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> Likewise urge the young men to be sensible;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> in all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, <i>with</i> purity in doctrine, dignified,
<br><font size="-1">8</font> sound <i>in</i> speech which is beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> <i>Urge</i> bondslaves to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not argumentative,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> not pilfering, but showing all good faith so that they will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in every respect.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
<br><font size="-1">12</font> instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you.

<font size="-1">1</font> Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> to malign no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing every consideration for all men.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For we also once were foolish ourselves, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> But when the kindness of God our Savior and <i>His</i> love for mankind appeared,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to <i>the</i> hope of eternal life.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> This is a trustworthy statement; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently, so that those who have believed God will be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and profitable for men.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and disputes about the Law, for they are unprofitable and worthless.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Reject a factious man after a first and second warning,
<br><font size="-1">11</font> knowing that such a man is perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned.

<br><font size="-1">6</font> <i>and I pray</i> that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you for Christ''s sake.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> Therefore, though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you <i>to do</i> what is proper,
<br><font size="-1">9</font> yet for love''s sake I rather appeal <i>to you</i>&#151;since I am such a person as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus&#151;
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="573s"></a>Plea for Onesimus, a Free Man</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">10</font> I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment,

<br><font size="-1">12</font> I have sent him back to you in person, that is, <i>sending</i> my very heart,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> whom I wished to keep with me, so that on your behalf he might minister to me in my imprisonment for the gospel;
<br><font size="-1">14</font> but without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of your own free will.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> For perhaps he was for this reason separated <i>from you</i> for a while, that you would have him back forever,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> If then you regard me a partner, accept him as <i>you would</i> me.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to my account;
<br><font size="-1">19</font> I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well).
<br><font size="-1">20</font> Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>21</b></font> Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, since I know that you will do even more than what I say.
<br><font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> At the same time also prepare me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you.

<br><font size="-1">7</font> And of the angels He says, <br>"W<font size="-1">HO MAKES</font> H<font size="-1">IS ANGELS WINDS</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND</font> H<font size="-1">IS MINISTERS A FLAME OF FIRE</font>."

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="582s"></a>Give Heed</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away <i>from it.</i>
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For if the word spoken through angels proved unalterable, and every transgression and disobedience received a just penalty,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? After it was at the first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own will.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="583s"></a>Earth Subject to Man</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> For He did not subject to angels the world to come, concerning which we are speaking.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But one has testified somewhere, saying, <br>"W<font size="-1">HAT IS MAN</font>, <font size="-1">THAT</font> Y<font size="-1">OU REMEMBER HIM</font>? <br>O<font size="-1">R THE SON OF MAN</font>, <font size="-1">THAT</font> Y<font size="-1">OU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HIM</font>?
<br><font size="-1">7</font> "Y<font size="-1">OU HAVE MADE HIM</font> <font size="-1">FOR A LITTLE WHILE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS</font>; <br>Y<font size="-1">OU HAVE CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND HONOR</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND HAVE APPOINTED HIM OVER THE</font> <font size="-1">WORKS OF</font> Y<font size="-1">OUR HANDS</font>;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Y<font size="-1">OU HAVE PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET</font>." <br>For in subjecting all things to him, He left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="584s"></a>Jesus Briefly Humbled</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">9</font> But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than the angels, <i>namely,</i> Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one <i>Father;</i> for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren,
<br><font size="-1">12</font> saying, <br>"I <font size="-1">WILL PROCLAIM</font> Y<font size="-1">OUR NAME TO</font> M<font size="-1">Y BRETHREN</font>, <br>I<font size="-1">N THE MIDST OF THE</font> <font size="-1">CONGREGATION</font> I<font size="-1"> WILL SING</font> Y<font size="-1">OUR PRAISE</font>."

<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,
<br><font size="-1">15</font> and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> For assuredly He does not give help to angels, but He gives help to the descendant of Abraham.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Therefore, He had to be made like His brethren in all things, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has suffered, He is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="583"></a>HEBREWS: CHAPTER 3&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="585s"></a>Jesus Our High Priest</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession;
<br><font size="-1">2</font> He was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later;
<br><font size="-1">6</font> but Christ <i>was faithful</i> as a Son over His house&#151;whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, <br>"T<font size="-1">ODAY IF YOU HEAR</font> H<font size="-1">IS VOICE</font>,
<br><font size="-1">8</font> D<font size="-1">O NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS AS</font> <font size="-1">WHEN</font> <font size="-1">THEY PROVOKED</font> M<font size="-1">E</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">S IN THE DAY OF TRIAL IN THE WILDERNESS</font>,

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="586s"></a>The Peril of Unbelief</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">12</font> Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is <i>still</i> called "Today," so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end,
<br><font size="-1">15</font> while it is said, <br>"T<font size="-1">ODAY IF YOU HEAR</font> H<font size="-1">IS VOICE</font>, <br>D<font size="-1">O NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS</font>, <font size="-1">AS</font> <font size="-1">WHEN THEY</font> <font size="-1">PROVOKED</font> M<font size="-1">E</font>."
<br><font size="-1">16</font> For who provoked <i>Him</i> when they had heard? Indeed, did not all those who came out of Egypt <i>led</i> by Moses?
<br><font size="-1">17</font> And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
<br><font size="-1">18</font> And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who were disobedient?
<br><font size="-1">19</font> <i>So</i> we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="584"></a>HEBREWS: CHAPTER 4&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="587s"></a>The Believer''s Rest</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said, <br>"A<font size="-1">S</font> I <font size="-1">SWORE IN</font> M<font size="-1">Y WRATH</font>, <br>T<font size="-1">HEY SHALL NOT ENTER</font> M<font size="-1">Y REST</font>," <br>although His works were finished from the foundation of the world.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh <i>day:</i> "A<font size="-1">ND</font> G<font size="-1">OD</font> <font size="-1">RESTED ON THE</font> <font size="-1">SEVENTH DAY FROM ALL</font> H<font size="-1">IS WORKS</font>";
<br><font size="-1">5</font> and again in this <i>passage,</i> "T<font size="-1">HEY</font> <font size="-1">SHALL NOT ENTER</font> M<font size="-1">Y REST</font>."
<br><font size="-1">6</font> Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> He again fixes a certain day, "Today," saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before, <br>"T<font size="-1">ODAY IF YOU HEAR</font> H<font size="-1">IS VOICE</font>, <br>D<font size="-1">O NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS</font>."
<br><font size="-1">8</font> For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall, through <i>following</i> the same example of disobedience.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as <i>we are, yet</i> without sin.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="585"></a>HEBREWS: CHAPTER 5&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="588s"></a>The Perfect High Priest</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;
<br><font size="-1">2</font> he can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since he himself also is beset with weakness;
<br><font size="-1">3</font> and because of it he is obligated to offer <i>sacrifices</i> for sins, as for the people, so also for himself.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> And no one takes the honor to himself, but <i>receives it</i> when he is called by God, even as Aaron was.
<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> So also Christ did not glorify Himself so as to become a high priest, but He who said to Him, <br>"Y<font size="-1">OU ARE</font> M<font size="-1">Y</font> S<font size="-1">ON</font>, <br>T<font size="-1">ODAY</font> I <font size="-1">HAVE BEGOTTEN</font> Y<font size="-1">OU</font>";
<br><font size="-1">6</font> just as He says also in another <i>passage,</i> <br>"Y<font size="-1">OU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER</font> <br>A<font size="-1">CCORDING TO</font> <font size="-1">THE ORDER OF</font> M<font size="-1">ELCHIZEDEK</font>."
<br><font size="-1">7</font> In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His piety.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> And having been made perfect, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> Concerning him we have much to say, and <i>it is</i> hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> For everyone who partakes <i>only</i> of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness, for he is an infant.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="586"></a>HEBREWS: CHAPTER 6&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="589s"></a>The Peril of Falling Away</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> of instruction about washings and laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> And this we will do, if God permits.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> and <i>then</i> have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For ground that drinks the rain which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="5810s"></a>Better Things for You</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany salvation, though we are speaking in this way.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end,
<br><font size="-1">12</font> so that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> saying, "I <font size="-1">WILL SURELY BLESS YOU AND</font> I <font size="-1">WILL</font> <font size="-1">SURELY MULTIPLY YOU</font>."
<br><font size="-1">15</font> And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> For men swear by one greater <i>than themselves,</i> and with them an oath <i>given</i> as confirmation is an end of every dispute.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> In the same way God, desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose, interposed with an oath,
<br><font size="-1">18</font> so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a <i>hope</i> both sure and steadfast and one which enters within the veil,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="587"></a>HEBREWS: CHAPTER 7&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="5811s"></a>Melchizedek''s Priesthood Like Christ''s</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all <i>the spoils,</i> was first of all, by the translation <i>of his name,</i> king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest''s office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one <i>receives them,</i> of whom it is witnessed that he lives on.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need <i>was there</i> for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron?
<br><font size="-1">12</font> For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> who has become <i>such</i> not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For it is attested <i>of Him,</i> <br>"Y<font size="-1">OU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER</font> <br>A<font size="-1">CCORDING TO THE ORDER OF</font> M<font size="-1">ELCHIZEDEK</font>."
<br><font size="-1">18</font> For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness
<br><font size="-1">19</font> (for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> And inasmuch as <i>it was</i> not without an oath
<br><font size="-1">21</font> (for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him, <br>"T<font size="-1">HE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD HAS SWORN</font> <br>A<font size="-1">ND</font> <font size="-1">WILL NOT CHANGE</font> H<font size="-1">IS MIND</font>, <br>''Y<font size="-1">OU ARE A PRIEST</font> <font size="-1">FOREVER</font>''&nbsp;");
<br><font size="-1">22</font> so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.
<br><font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> The <i>former</i> priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing,
<br><font size="-1">24</font> but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.
<br><font size="-1"><b>26</b></font> For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens;
<br><font size="-1">27</font> who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the <i>sins</i> of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, <i>appoints</i> a Son, made perfect forever.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="588"></a>HEBREWS: CHAPTER 8&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="5812s"></a>A Better Ministry</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now the main point in what has been said <i>is this:</i> we have such a high priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> a minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this <i>high priest</i> also have something to offer.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law;
<br><font size="-1">5</font> who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned <i>by God</i> when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, "S<font size="-1">EE</font>," He says, "<font size="-1">THAT YOU MAKE</font> all things <font size="-1">ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN WHICH WAS SHOWN YOU ON THE</font> <font size="-1">MOUNTAIN</font>."

<br><font size="-1">13</font> When He said, "A new <i>covenant,</i>" He has made the first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to disappear.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="589"></a>HEBREWS: CHAPTER 9&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="5814s"></a>The Old and the New</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now even the first <i>covenant</i> had regulations of divine worship and the earthly sanctuary.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For there was a tabernacle prepared, the outer one, in which <i>were</i> the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread; this is called the holy place.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Behind the second veil there was a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron''s rod which budded, and the tables of the covenant;
<br><font size="-1">5</font> and above it <i>were</i> the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; but of these things we cannot now speak in detail.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> Now when these things have been so prepared, the priests are continually entering the outer tabernacle performing the divine worship,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> but into the second, only the high priest <i>enters</i> once a year, not without <i>taking</i> blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> The Holy Spirit <i>is</i> signifying this, that the way into the holy place has not yet been disclosed while the outer tabernacle is still standing,
<br><font size="-1">9</font> which <i>is</i> a symbol for the present time. Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make the worshiper perfect in conscience,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> since they <i>relate</i> only to food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until a time of reformation.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> But when Christ appeared <i>as</i> a high priest of the good things to come, <i>He entered</i> through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation;
<br><font size="-1">12</font> and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were <i>committed</i> under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For a covenant is valid <i>only</i> when men are dead, for it is never in force while the one who made it lives.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Therefore even the first <i>covenant</i> was not inaugurated without blood.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> saying, "T<font size="-1">HIS IS THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT</font> <font size="-1">WHICH</font> G<font size="-1">OD COMMANDED YOU</font>."
<br><font size="-1">21</font> And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> And according to the Law, <i>one may</i> almost <i>say,</i> all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
<br><font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a <i>mere</i> copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;
<br><font size="-1">25</font> nor was it that He would offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood that is not his own.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this <i>comes</i> judgment,
<br><font size="-1">28</font> so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time for salvation without <i>reference to</i> sin, to those who eagerly await Him.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="5810"></a>HEBREWS: CHAPTER 10&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="5815s"></a>One Sacrifice of Christ Is Sufficient</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> For the Law, since it has <i>only</i> a shadow of the good things to come <i>and</i> not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually year by year, make perfect those who draw near.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins?
<br><font size="-1">3</font> But in those <i>sacrifices</i> there is a reminder of sins year by year.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says, <br>"S<font size="-1">ACRIFICE AND OFFERING</font> Y<font size="-1">OU HAVE NOT DESIRED</font>, <br>B<font size="-1">UT</font> <font size="-1">A BODY</font> Y<font size="-1">OU HAVE PREPARED FOR</font> M<font size="-1">E</font>;

<br><font size="-1">8</font> After saying above, "S<font size="-1">ACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS AND</font> <font size="-1">WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND</font> <i>sacrifices</i> <font size="-1">FOR SIN</font> Y<font size="-1">OU HAVE NOT DESIRED</font>, <font size="-1">NOR HAVE</font> Y<font size="-1">OU TAKEN PLEASURE</font> <i>in them</i>" (which are offered according to the Law),
<br><font size="-1">9</font> then He said, "B<font size="-1">EHOLD</font>, I <font size="-1">HAVE COME TO DO</font> Y<font size="-1">OUR WILL</font>." He takes away the first in order to establish the second.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins;
<br><font size="-1">12</font> but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, <font size="-1">SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF</font> G<font size="-1">OD</font>,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> waiting from that time onward <font size="-1">UNTIL</font> H<font size="-1">IS</font> <font size="-1">ENEMIES BE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR</font> H<font size="-1">IS FEET</font>.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> "T<font size="-1">HIS IS THE COVENANT THAT</font> I <font size="-1">WILL MAKE WITH THEM</font> <br>A<font size="-1">FTER THOSE DAYS</font>, <font size="-1">SAYS THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD</font>: <br>I <font size="-1">WILL PUT</font> M<font size="-1">Y LAWS UPON THEIR HEART</font>, <br>A<font size="-1">ND ON THEIR MIND</font> I <font size="-1">WILL WRITE THEM</font>," <br><i>He then says,</i>
<br><font size="-1">17</font> "A<font size="-1">ND THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS</font> <br>I <font size="-1">WILL REMEMBER NO MORE</font>."
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer <i>any</i> offering for sin.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="5816s"></a>A New and Living Way</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh,
<br><font size="-1">21</font> and since <i>we have</i> a great priest over the house of God,
<br><font size="-1">22</font> let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled <i>clean</i> from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful;
<br><font size="-1">24</font> and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,
<br><font size="-1">25</font> not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging <i>one another;</i> and all the more as you see the day drawing near.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="5817s"></a>Christ or Judgment</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>26</b></font> For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
<br><font size="-1">27</font> but a terrifying expectation of judgment and <font size="-1">THE</font> <font size="-1">FURY OF A FIRE WHICH WILL CONSUME THE ADVERSARIES</font>.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on <i>the testimony of</i> two or three witnesses.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?
<br><font size="-1">30</font> For we know Him who said, "V<font size="-1">ENGEANCE IS</font> M<font size="-1">INE</font>, I <font size="-1">WILL REPAY</font>." And again, "T<font size="-1">HE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD WILL JUDGE</font> H<font size="-1">IS PEOPLE</font>."
<br><font size="-1">31</font> It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>32</b></font> But remember the former days, when, after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings,
<br><font size="-1">33</font> partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations, and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated.
<br><font size="-1">34</font> For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one.
<br><font size="-1">35</font> Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.
<br><font size="-1">36</font> For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.
<br><font size="-1">37</font> F<font size="-1">OR YET IN A VERY LITTLE WHILE</font>, <br>H<font size="-1">E WHO IS COMING WILL COME</font>, <font size="-1">AND WILL NOT DELAY</font>.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="5818s"></a>The Triumphs of Faith</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Now faith is the assurance of <i>things</i> hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For by it the men of old gained approval.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; <font size="-1">AND HE WAS NOT FOUND BECAUSE</font> G<font size="-1">OD TOOK HIM UP</font>; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> And without faith it is impossible to please <i>Him,</i> for he who comes to God must believe that He is and <i>that</i> He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> By faith Noah, being warned <i>by God</i> about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign <i>land,</i> dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise;
<br><font size="-1">10</font> for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good as dead at that, <i>as many descendants</i> <font size="-1">AS THE STARS OF HEAVEN IN NUMBER</font>, <font size="-1">AND INNUMERABLE AS THE SAND WHICH IS BY THE SEASHORE</font>.
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> And indeed if they had been thinking of that <i>country</i> from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> But as it is, they desire a better <i>country,</i> that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them.
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten <i>son;</i>
<br><font size="-1">18</font> <i>it was he</i> to whom it was said, "I<font size="-1">N</font> I<font size="-1">SAAC YOUR</font> <font size="-1">DESCENDANTS SHALL BE CALLED</font>."
<br><font size="-1">19</font> He considered that God is able to raise <i>people</i> even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, <i>leaning</i> on the top of his staff.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.
<br><font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king''s edict.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh''s daughter,
<br><font size="-1">25</font> choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin,
<br><font size="-1">26</font> considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though <i>they were passing</i> through dry land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.
<br><font size="-1"><b>30</b></font> By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.
<br><font size="-1">31</font> By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies in peace.
<br><font size="-1"><b>32</b></font> And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets,
<br><font size="-1">33</font> who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed <i>acts of</i> righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,
<br><font size="-1">34</font> quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.
<br><font size="-1">35</font> Women received <i>back</i> their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection;
<br><font size="-1">36</font> and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment.
<br><font size="-1">37</font> They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated
<br><font size="-1">38</font> (<i>men</i> of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground.
<br><font size="-1"><b>39</b></font> And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised,
<br><font size="-1">40</font> because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.

<br><font size="-1">2</font> fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="5820s"></a>A Father''s Discipline</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">4</font> You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin;
<br><font size="-1">5</font> and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons, <br>"M<font size="-1">Y SON</font>, <font size="-1">DO NOT REGARD LIGHTLY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE</font> L<font size="-1">ORD</font>, <br>N<font size="-1">OR</font> <font size="-1">FAINT WHEN YOU ARE REPROVED BY</font> H<font size="-1">IM</font>;

<br><font size="-1">7</font> It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom <i>his</i> father does not discipline?
<br><font size="-1">8</font> But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits, and live?
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He <i>disciplines us</i> for <i>our</i> good, so that we may share His holiness.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> and make straight paths for your feet, so that <i>the limb</i> which is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled;
<br><font size="-1">16</font> that <i>there be</i> no immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a <i>single</i> meal.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For you know that even afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears.

<br><font size="-1">23</font> to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of <i>the</i> righteous made perfect,
<br><font size="-1">24</font> and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks better than <i>the blood</i> of Abel.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="5822s"></a>The Unshaken Kingdom</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>25</b></font> See to it that you do not refuse Him who is speaking. For if those did not escape when they refused him who warned <i>them</i> on earth, much less <i>will</i> we <i>escape</i> who turn away from Him who <i>warns</i> from heaven.
<br><font size="-1">26</font> And His voice shook the earth then, but now He has promised, saying, "Y<font size="-1">ET ONCE MORE</font> I <font size="-1">WILL SHAKE NOT ONLY THE EARTH</font>, <font size="-1">BUT ALSO THE HEAVEN</font>."
<br><font size="-1">27</font> This <i>expression,</i> "Yet once more," denotes the removing of those things which can be shaken, as of created things, so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
<br><font size="-1">28</font> Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe;
<br><font size="-1">29</font> for our God is a consuming fire.

<br><font size="-1">4</font> Marriage <i>is to be held</i> in honor among all, and the <i>marriage</i> bed <i>is to be</i> undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> <i>Make sure that</i> your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, "I <font size="-1">WILL NEVER DESERT YOU</font>, <font size="-1">NOR WILL</font> I <font size="-1">EVER FORSAKE</font> <font size="-1">YOU</font>,"

<br><font size="-1">10</font> We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest <i>as an offering</i> for sin, are burned outside the camp.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> So, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.

<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> Obey your leaders and submit <i>to them,</i> for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="591s"></a>Testing Your Faith</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> To the twelve tribes who are dispersed abroad: Greetings.
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> And let endurance have <i>its</i> perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord,
<br><font size="-1">8</font> <i>being</i> a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position;
<br><font size="-1">10</font> and the rich man <i>is to glory</i> in his humiliation, because like flowering grass he will pass away.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For the sun rises with a scorching wind and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so too the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will fade away.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which <i>the Lord</i> has promised to those who love Him.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am being tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> In the exercise of His will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits among His creatures.
<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> <i>This</i> you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak <i>and</i> slow to anger;
<br><font size="-1">20</font> for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and <i>all</i> that remains of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;
<br><font size="-1">24</font> for <i>once</i> he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the <i>law</i> of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does.
<br><font size="-1"><b>26</b></font> If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his <i>own</i> heart, this man''s religion is worthless.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of <i>our</i> God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, <i>and</i> to keep oneself unstained by the world.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="592"></a>JAMES: CHAPTER 2&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="592s"></a>The Sin of Partiality</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> My brethren, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with <i>an attitude of</i> personal favoritism.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in dirty clothes,
<br><font size="-1">3</font> and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes, and say, "You sit here in a good place," and you say to the poor man, "You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool,"
<br><font size="-1">4</font> have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives?
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Listen, my beloved brethren: did not God choose the poor of this world <i>to be</i> rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you and personally drag you into court?
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Do they not blaspheme the fair name by which you have been called?
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, "Y<font size="-1">OU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF</font>," you are doing well.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> But if you show partiality, you are committing sin <i>and</i> are convicted by the law as transgressors.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one <i>point,</i> he has become guilty of all.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> For He who said, "D<font size="-1">O NOT COMMIT ADULTERY</font>," also said, "D<font size="-1">O NOT COMMIT MURDER</font>." Now if you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by <i>the</i> law of liberty.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> For judgment <i>will be</i> merciless to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="593s"></a>Faith and Works</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him?
<br><font size="-1">15</font> If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and be filled," and yet you do not give them what is necessary for <i>their</i> body, what use is that?
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, <i>being</i> by itself.
<br><font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> But someone may <i>well</i> say, "You have faith and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works."
<br><font size="-1">19</font> You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless?
<br><font size="-1">21</font> Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?
<br><font size="-1">22</font> You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected;
<br><font size="-1">23</font> and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "A<font size="-1">ND</font> A<font size="-1">BRAHAM BELIEVED</font> G<font size="-1">OD</font>, <font size="-1">AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS</font>," and he was called the friend of God.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?
<br><font size="-1">26</font> For just as the body without <i>the</i> spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="593"></a>JAMES: CHAPTER 3&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="594s"></a>The Tongue Is a Fire</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Let not many <i>of you</i> become teachers, my brethren, knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> For we all stumble in many <i>ways.</i> If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Now if we put the bits into the horses'' mouths so that they will obey us, we direct their entire body as well.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Look at the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot desires.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and <i>yet</i> it boasts of great things.
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire!
<br><font size="-1">6</font> And the tongue is a fire, the <i>very</i> world of iniquity; the tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body, and sets on fire the course of <i>our</i> life, and is set on fire by hell.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> But no one can tame the tongue; <i>it is</i> a restless evil <i>and</i> full of deadly poison.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> With it we bless <i>our</i> Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God;
<br><font size="-1">10</font> from the same mouth come <i>both</i> blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be this way.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Does a fountain send out from the same opening <i>both</i> fresh and bitter <i>water?</i>
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine produce figs? Nor <i>can</i> salt water produce fresh.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="595s"></a>Wisdom from Above</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and <i>so</i> lie against the truth.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="594"></a>JAMES: CHAPTER 4&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="596s"></a>Things to Avoid</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members?
<br><font size="-1">2</font> You lust and do not have; <i>so</i> you commit murder. You are envious and cannot obtain; <i>so</i> you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend <i>it</i> on your pleasures.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose: "He jealously desires the Spirit which He has made to dwell in us"?
<br><font size="-1">6</font> But He gives a greater grace. Therefore <i>it</i> says, "G<font size="-1">OD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD</font>, <font size="-1">BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE</font>."
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Be miserable and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to gloom.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge <i>of it.</i>
<br><font size="-1">12</font> There is <i>only</i> one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and to destroy; but who are you who judge your neighbor?
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit."
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are <i>just</i> a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Instead, <i>you ought</i> to say, "If the Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that."
<br><font size="-1">16</font> But as it is, you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Therefore, to one who knows <i>the</i> right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="595"></a>JAMES: CHAPTER 5&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="597s"></a>Misuse of Riches</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Your gold and your silver have rusted; and their rust will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire. It is in the last days that you have stored up your treasure!
<br><font size="-1">4</font> Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields, <i>and</i> which has been withheld by you, cries out <i>against you;</i> and the outcry of those who did the harvesting has reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> You have lived luxuriously on the earth and led a life of wanton pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> You have condemned and put to death the righteous <i>man;</i> he does not resist you.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="598s"></a>Exhortation</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it, until it gets the early and late rains.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Do not complain, brethren, against one another, so that you yourselves may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing right at the door.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> As an example, brethren, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> We count those blessed who endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome of the Lord''s dealings, that the Lord is full of compassion and <i>is</i> merciful.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath; but your yes is to be yes, and your no, no, so that you may not fall under judgment.
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> Is anyone among you suffering? <i>Then</i> he must pray. Is anyone cheerful? He is to sing praises.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> Is anyone among you sick? <i>Then</i> he must call for the elders of the church and they are to pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;
<br><font size="-1">15</font> and the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Then he prayed again, and the sky poured rain and the earth produced its fruit.
<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> My brethren, if any among you strays from the truth and one turns him back,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.

<br><font size="-1">4</font> to <i>obtain</i> an inheritance <i>which is</i> imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials,

<br><font size="-1">9</font> obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls.
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that <i>would come</i> to you made careful searches and inquiries,

<br><font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart,
<br><font size="-1">23</font> for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable, <i>that is,</i> through the living and enduring word of God.

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation,

<font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> For <i>this</i> is contained in Scripture: <br>"B<font size="-1">EHOLD</font>, I <font size="-1">LAY IN</font> Z<font size="-1">ION A CHOICE STONE</font>, <font size="-1">A</font> <font size="-1">PRECIOUS CORNER</font> <i>stone,</i> <br>A<font size="-1">ND HE WHO BELIEVES IN</font> H<font size="-1">IM WILL NOT BE</font> <font size="-1">DISAPPOINTED</font>."

<br><font size="-1">8</font> and, <br>"A <font size="-1">STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE</font>"; <br>for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this <i>doom</i> they were also appointed.
<br><font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> But you are <font size="-1">A CHOSEN RACE</font>, <font size="-1">A</font> royal <font size="-1">PRIESTHOOD</font>, <font size="-1">A</font> <font size="-1">HOLY NATION</font>, <font size="-1">A PEOPLE FOR</font> <i>God''s</i> <font size="-1">OWN POSSESSION</font>, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;

<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe <i>them,</i> glorify God in the day of visitation.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="604s"></a>Honor Authority</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> Submit yourselves for the Lord''s sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> <i>Act</i> as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but <i>use it</i> as bondslaves of God.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king.
<br><font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> For this <i>finds</i> favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer <i>for it</i> you patiently endure it, this <i>finds</i> favor with God.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="605s"></a>Christ Is Our Example</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">21</font> For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps,
<br><font size="-1">22</font> <font size="-1">WHO</font> <font size="-1">COMMITTED NO SIN</font>, <font size="-1">NOR WAS ANY DECEIT FOUND IN</font> H<font size="-1">IS MOUTH</font>;
<br><font size="-1">23</font> and while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting <i>Himself</i> to Him who judges righteously;
<br><font size="-1">24</font> and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed.
<br><font size="-1">25</font> For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="606s"></a>Godly Living</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any <i>of them</i> are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> as they observe your chaste and respectful behavior.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Your adornment must not be <i>merely</i> external&#151;braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> but <i>let it be</i> the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands;
<br><font size="-1">6</font> just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, and you have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> You husbands in the same way, live with <i>your wives</i> in an understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit;
<br><font size="-1">9</font> not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> For, <br>"T<font size="-1">HE ONE WHO DESIRES LIFE</font>, <font size="-1">TO LOVE AND SEE GOOD DAYS</font>, <br>M<font size="-1">UST KEEP HIS TONGUE FROM EVIL AND HIS LIPS FROM SPEAKING DECEIT</font>.

<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good?
<br><font size="-1">14</font> But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. A<font size="-1">ND DO NOT FEAR THEIR</font> <font size="-1">INTIMIDATION</font>, <font size="-1">AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED</font>,
<br><font size="-1">15</font> but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always <i>being</i> ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence;
<br><font size="-1">16</font> and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For it is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> For Christ also died for sins once for all, <i>the</i> just for <i>the</i> unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;
<br><font size="-1">19</font> in which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits <i>now</i> in prison,
<br><font size="-1">20</font> who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through <i>the</i> water.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you&#151;not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience&#151;through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
<br><font size="-1">22</font> who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="604"></a>1 PETER: CHAPTER 4&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="607s"></a>Keep Fervent in Your Love</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For the time already past is sufficient <i>for</i> <i>you</i> to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties and abominable idolatries.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> In <i>all</i> this, they are surprised that you do not run with <i>them</i> into the same excesses of dissipation, and they malign <i>you;</i>
<br><font size="-1">5</font> but they will give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they may live in the spirit according to <i>the</i> <i>will of</i> God.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> The end of all things is near; therefore, be of sound judgment and sober <i>spirit</i> for the purpose of prayer.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Be hospitable to one another without complaint.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> As each one has received a <i>special</i> gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Whoever speaks, <i>is to do so</i> as one who is speaking the utterances of God; whoever serves <i>is to do so</i> as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="608s"></a>Share the Sufferings of Christ</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you;
<br><font size="-1">13</font> but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exultation.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler;
<br><font size="-1">16</font> but if <i>anyone suffers</i> as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God in this name.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For <i>it is</i> time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if <i>it begins</i> with us first, what <i>will be</i> the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
<br><font size="-1">18</font> A<font size="-1">ND IF IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE RIGHTEOUS IS SAVED</font>, <font size="-1">WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE</font> <font size="-1">GODLESS MAN AND THE SINNER</font>?

<font size="-1">1</font> Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as <i>your</i> fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to <i>the will of</i> God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness;
<br><font size="-1">3</font> nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> You younger men, likewise, be subject to <i>your</i> elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for G<font size="-1">OD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD</font>, <font size="-1">BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE</font>.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="611s"></a>Growth in Christian Virtue</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Simon Peter, a bond-servant and apostle of Jesus Christ,
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> To those who have received a faith of the same kind as ours, by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ:
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;
<br><font size="-1">3</font> seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of <i>the</i> divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Now for this very reason also, applying all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence, and in <i>your</i> moral excellence, knowledge,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> and in <i>your</i> knowledge, self-control, and in <i>your</i> self-control, perseverance, and in <i>your</i> perseverance, godliness,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> and in <i>your</i> godliness, brotherly kindness, and in <i>your</i> brotherly kindness, love.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> For if these <i>qualities</i> are yours and are increasing, they render you neither useless nor unfruitful in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> For he who lacks these <i>qualities</i> is blind <i>or</i> short-sighted, having forgotten <i>his</i> purification from his former sins.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Therefore, brethren, be all the more diligent to make certain about His calling and choosing you; for as long as you practice these things, you will never stumble;
<br><font size="-1">11</font> for in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> Therefore, I will always be ready to remind you of these things, even though you <i>already</i> know <i>them,</i> and have been established in the truth which is present with <i>you.</i>
<br><font size="-1">13</font> I consider it right, as long as I am in this <i>earthly</i> dwelling, to stir you up by way of reminder,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> knowing that the laying aside of my <i>earthly</i> dwelling is imminent, as also our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> And I will also be diligent that at any time after my departure you will be able to call these things to mind.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="612s"></a>Eyewitnesses</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, such an utterance as this was made to Him by the Majestic Glory, "This is My beloved Son with whom I am well-pleased"&#151;
<br><font size="-1">18</font> and we ourselves heard this utterance made from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.
<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> <i>So</i> we have the prophetic word <i>made</i> more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is <i>a matter</i> of one''s own interpretation,
<br><font size="-1">21</font> for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="612"></a>2 PETER: CHAPTER 2&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="613s"></a>The Rise of False Prophets</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of the truth will be maligned;
<br><font size="-1">3</font> and in <i>their</i> greed they will exploit you with false words; their judgment from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for judgment;
<br><font size="-1">5</font> and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;
<br><font size="-1">6</font> and <i>if</i> He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing <i>them</i> to ashes, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly <i>lives</i> thereafter;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> and <i>if</i> He rescued righteous Lot, oppressed by the sensual conduct of unprincipled men
<br><font size="-1">8</font> (for by what he saw and heard <i>that</i> righteous man, while living among them, felt <i>his</i> righteous soul tormented day after day by <i>their</i> lawless deeds),
<br><font size="-1">9</font> <i>then</i> the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> and especially those who indulge the flesh in <i>its</i> corrupt desires and despise authority.
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> Daring, self-willed, they do not tremble when they revile angelic majesties,
<br><font size="-1">11</font> whereas angels who are greater in might and power do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> But these, like unreasoning animals, born as creatures of instinct to be captured and killed, reviling where they have no knowledge, will in the destruction of those creatures also be destroyed,
<br><font size="-1">13</font> suffering wrong as the wages of doing wrong. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, as they carouse with you,
<br><font size="-1">14</font> having eyes full of adultery that never cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart trained in greed, accursed children;
<br><font size="-1">15</font> forsaking the right way, they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam, the <i>son</i> of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;
<br><font size="-1">16</font> but he received a rebuke for his own transgression, <i>for</i> a mute donkey, speaking with a voice of a man, restrained the madness of the prophet.
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm, for whom the black darkness has been reserved.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> For speaking out arrogant <i>words</i> of vanity they entice by fleshly desires, by sensuality, those who barely escape from the ones who live in error,
<br><font size="-1">19</font> promising them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by what a man is overcome, by this he is enslaved.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment handed on to them.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> It has happened to them according to the true proverb, "A <font size="-1">DOG RETURNS TO ITS OWN VOMIT</font>," and, "A sow, after washing, <i>returns</i> to wallowing in the mire."

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="614s"></a>Purpose of This Letter</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> This is now, beloved, the second letter I am writing to you in which I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> that you should remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior <i>spoken</i> by your apostles.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="615s"></a>The Coming Day of the Lord</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">3</font> Know this first of all, that in the last days mockers will come with <i>their</i> mocking, following after their own lusts,
<br><font size="-1">4</font> and saying, "Where is the promise of His coming? For <i>ever</i> since the fathers fell asleep, all continues just as it was from the beginning of creation."
<br><font size="-1">5</font> For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by the word of God <i>the</i> heavens existed long ago and <i>the</i> earth was formed out of water and by water,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> through which the world at that time was destroyed, being flooded with water.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> But by His word the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> But do not let this one <i>fact</i> escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="616s"></a>A New Heaven and Earth</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">10</font> But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,
<br><font size="-1">12</font> looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by burning, and the elements will melt with intense heat!
<br><font size="-1">13</font> But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, spotless and blameless,
<br><font size="-1">15</font> and regard the patience of our Lord <i>as</i> salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you,
<br><font size="-1">16</font> as also in all <i>his</i> letters, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as <i>they do</i> also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard so that you are not carried away by the error of unprincipled men and fall from your own steadfastness,
<br><font size="-1">18</font> but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him <i>be</i> the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.

<font size="-1">1</font> What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the Word of Life&#151;
<br><font size="-1">2</font> and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us&#151;
<br><font size="-1">3</font> what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you also, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> These things we write, so that our joy may be made complete.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="622s"></a>God Is Light</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> If we say that we have fellowship with Him and <i>yet</i> walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth;
<br><font size="-1">7</font> but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="622"></a>1 JOHN: CHAPTER 2&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="623s"></a>Christ Is Our Advocate</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous;
<br><font size="-1">2</font> and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for <i>those of</i> the whole world.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> By this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> The one who says, "I have come to know Him," and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;
<br><font size="-1">5</font> but whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God has truly been perfected. By this we know that we are in Him:
<br><font size="-1">6</font> the one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you have heard.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true Light is already shining.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> The one who says he is in the Light and <i>yet</i> hates his brother is in the darkness until now.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> The one who loves his brother abides in the Light and there is no cause for stumbling in him.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you for His name''s sake.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children, because you know the Father.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="624s"></a>Do Not Love the World</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> The world is passing away, and <i>also</i> its lusts; but the one who does the will of God lives forever.
<br><font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> Children, it is the last hour; and just as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared; from this we know that it is the last hour.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> They went out from us, but they were not <i>really</i> of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but <i>they went out,</i> so that it would be shown that they all are not of us.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie is of the truth.
<br><font size="-1">22</font> Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.
<br><font size="-1">23</font> Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> As for you, let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="625s"></a>The Promise Is Eternal Life</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">25</font> This is the promise which He Himself made to us: eternal life.
<br><font size="-1"><b>26</b></font> These things I have written to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you.
<br><font size="-1">27</font> As for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you abide in Him.
<br><font size="-1"><b>28</b></font> Now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He appears, we may have confidence and not shrink away from Him in shame at His coming.
<br><font size="-1">29</font> If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone also who practices righteousness is born of Him.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="623"></a>1 JOHN: CHAPTER 3&nbsp;<a href="#NT"><font size="1">[Books]</font></a></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="626s"></a>Children of God Love One Another</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we would be called children of God; and <i>such</i> we are. For this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> And everyone who has this hope <i>fixed</i> on Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> You know that He appeared in order to take away sins; and in Him there is no sin.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> Little children, make sure no one deceives you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous;
<br><font size="-1">8</font> the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;
<br><font size="-1">12</font> not as Cain, <i>who</i> was of the evil one and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother''s were righteous.
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> Do not be surprised, brethren, if the world hates you.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> We know love by this, that He laid down His life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> But whoever has the world''s goods, and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him?
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> We will know by this that we are of the truth, and will assure our heart before Him
<br><font size="-1">20</font> in whatever our heart condemns us; for God is greater than our heart and knows all things.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God;
<br><font size="-1">22</font> and whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight.
<br><font size="-1"><b>23</b></font> This is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as He commanded us.
<br><font size="-1">24</font> The one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. We know by this that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="627s"></a>Testing the Spirits</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God;
<br><font size="-1">3</font> and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the <i>spirit</i> of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> They are from the world; therefore they speak <i>as</i> from the world, and the world listens to them.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> We are from God; he who knows God listens to us; he who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="628s"></a>God Is Love</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> By this the love of God was manifested in us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son <i>to be</i> the propitiation for our sins.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son <i>to be</i> the Savior of the world.
<br><font size="-1"><b>15</b></font> Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> We have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, so also are we in this world.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> We love, because He first loved us.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> If someone says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="629s"></a>Overcoming the World</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and whoever loves the Father loves the <i>child</i> born of Him.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and observe His commandments.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that has overcome the world&#151;our faith.
<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> Who is the one who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
<br><font size="-1">6</font> This is the One who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For there are three that testify:
<br><font size="-1">8</font> the Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for the testimony of God is this, that He has testified concerning His Son.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning His Son.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="6210s"></a>This Is Written That You May Know</i></b></font></p>

<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not <i>leading</i> to death, he shall ask and <i>God</i> will for him give life to those who commit sin not <i>leading</i> to death. There is a sin <i>leading</i> to death; I do not say that he should make request for this.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not <i>leading</i> to death.

<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brethren, and especially <i>when they are</i> strangers;
<br><font size="-1">6</font> and they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> For they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.

<font size="-1">1</font> Jude, a bond-servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James,
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> To those who are the called, beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ:
<br><font size="-1">2</font> May mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> Beloved, while I was making every effort to write you about our common salvation, I felt the necessity to write to you appealing that you contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
<br><font size="-1"><b>5</b></font> Now I desire to remind you, though you know all things once for all, that the Lord, after saving a people out of the land of Egypt, subsequently destroyed those who did not believe.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> And angels who did not keep their own domain, but abandoned their proper abode, He has kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> Yet in the same way these men, also by dreaming, defile the flesh, and reject authority, and revile angelic majesties.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!"
<br><font size="-1">10</font> But these men revile the things which they do not understand; and the things which they know by instinct, like unreasoning animals, by these things they are destroyed.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> Woe to them! For they have gone the way of Cain, and for pay they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam, and perished in the rebellion of Korah.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> These are the men who are hidden reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you without fear, caring for themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, doubly dead, uprooted;
<br><font size="-1">13</font> wild waves of the sea, casting up their own shame like foam; wandering stars, for whom the black darkness has been reserved forever.
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> <i>It was</i> also about these men <i>that</i> Enoch, <i>in</i> the seventh <i>generation</i> from Adam, prophesied, saying, "Behold, the Lord came with many thousands of His holy ones,
<br><font size="-1">15</font> to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him."
<br><font size="-1">16</font> These are grumblers, finding fault, following after their <i>own</i> lusts; they speak arrogantly, flattering people for the sake of <i>gaining an</i> advantage.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="652s"></a>Keep Yourselves in the Love of God</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> But you, beloved, ought to remember the words that were spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,
<br><font size="-1">18</font> that they were saying to you, "In the last time there will be mockers, following after their own ungodly lusts."

<br><font size="-1">2</font> And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea,

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="6622s"></a>The 144,000</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:

<font size="-1"><b>9</b></font> After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could count, from every nation and <i>all</i> tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palm branches <i>were</i> in their hands;
<br><font size="-1">10</font> and they cry out with a loud voice, saying,

<br><font size="-1">14</font> I said to him, "My lord, you know." And he said to me, "These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

<font size="-1">1</font> When the Lamb broke the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, so that he might add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel''s hand.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Then the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it to the earth; and there followed peals of thunder and sounds and flashes of lightning and an earthquake.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> The first sounded, and there came hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> The second angel sounded, and <i>something</i> like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea; and a third of the sea became blood,
<br><font size="-1">9</font> and a third of the creatures which were in the sea and had life, died; and a third of the ships were destroyed.
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of waters.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> The name of the star is called Wormwood; and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> The fourth angel sounded, and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were struck, so that a third of them would be darkened and the day would not shine for a third of it, and the night in the same way.
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!"

<font size="-1">1</font> Then the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven which had fallen to the earth; and the key of the bottomless pit was given to him.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> He opened the bottomless pit, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> Then out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> And they were not permitted to kill anyone, but to torment for five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a man.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, and death flees from them.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> The appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle; and on their heads appeared to be crowns like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> They had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like <i>the teeth</i> of lions.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> They had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to battle.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> They have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men for five months.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> They have as king over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek he has the name Apollyon.

<br><font size="-1">15</font> And the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released, so that they would kill a third of mankind.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million; I heard the number of them.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> And this is how I saw in the vision the horses and those who sat on them: <i>the riders</i> had breastplates <i>the color</i> of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone; and the heads of the horses are like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceed fire and smoke and brimstone.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which proceeded out of their mouths.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with them they do harm.
<br><font size="-1"><b>20</b></font> The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so as not to worship demons, and the idols of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk;

<font size="-1">1</font> I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire;
<br><font size="-1">2</font> and he had in his hand a little book which was open. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left on the land;
<br><font size="-1">3</font> and he cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion roars; and when he had cried out, the seven peals of thunder uttered their voices.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> When the seven peals of thunder had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up the things which the seven peals of thunder have spoken and do not write them."
<br><font size="-1">5</font> Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to heaven,
<br><font size="-1">6</font> and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, <font size="-1">WHO CREATED HEAVEN AND THE THINGS IN IT</font>, <font size="-1">AND THE EARTH AND THE THINGS IN IT</font>, <font size="-1">AND THE SEA AND THE THINGS IN IT</font>, that there will be delay no longer,
<br><font size="-1">7</font> but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as He preached to His servants the prophets.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> Then the voice which I heard from heaven, <i>I heard</i> again speaking with me, and saying, "Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land."
<br><font size="-1">9</font> So I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. And he *said to me, "Take it and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey."
<br><font size="-1">10</font> I took the little book out of the angel''s hand and ate it, and in my mouth it was sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.

<br><font size="-1">2</font> "Leave out the court which is outside the temple and do not measure it, for it has been given to the nations; and they will tread under foot the holy city for forty-two months.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> "And I will grant <i>authority</i> to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth."
<br><font size="-1">4</font> These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> And if anyone wants to harm them, fire flows out of their mouth and devours their enemies; so if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> These have the power to shut up the sky, so that rain will not fall during the days of their prophesying; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them and kill them.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> And their dead bodies <i>will lie</i> in the street of the great city which mystically is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Those from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations <i>will</i> look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not permit their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> And those who dwell on the earth <i>will</i> rejoice over them and celebrate; and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.
<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God came into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those who were watching them.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." Then they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies watched them.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.

<br><font size="-1"><b>19</b></font> And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened; and the ark of His covenant appeared in His temple, and there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder and an earthquake and a great hailstorm.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="6630s"></a>The Woman, Israel</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars;
<br><font size="-1">2</font> and she was with child; and she *cried out, being in labor and in pain to give birth.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="6631s"></a>The Red Dragon, Satan</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">3</font> Then another sign appeared in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads <i>were</i> seven diadems.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> And his tail *swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="6632s"></a>The Male Child, Christ</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">5</font> And she gave birth to a son, a male <i>child,</i> who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> Then the woman fled into the wilderness where she *had a place prepared by God, so that there she would be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="6633s"></a>The Angel, Michael</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war,
<br><font size="-1">8</font> and they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying,
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> "Now the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, he who accuses them before our God day and night.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> "And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life even when faced with death.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> "For this reason, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has <i>only</i> a short time."
<br><font size="-1"><b>13</b></font> And when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male <i>child.</i>
<br><font size="-1">14</font> But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, so that she could fly into the wilderness to her place, where she *was nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> And the serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, so that he might cause her to be swept away with the flood.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon poured out of his mouth.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> So the dragon was enraged with the woman, and went off to make war with the rest of her children, who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.

<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns <i>were</i> ten diadems, and on his heads <i>were</i> blasphemous names.
<br><font size="-1">2</font> And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like <i>those</i> of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> <i>I saw</i> one of his heads as if it had been slain, and his fatal wound was healed. And the whole earth was amazed <i>and followed</i> after the beast;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast, and who is able to wage war with him?"
<br><font size="-1">5</font> There was given to him a mouth speaking arrogant words and blasphemies, and authority to act for forty-two months was given to him.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, <i>that is,</i> those who dwell in heaven.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> It was also given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them, and authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given to him.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> All who dwell on the earth will worship him, <i>everyone</i> whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been slain.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> If anyone has an ear, let him hear.
<br><font size="-1">10</font> If anyone <i>is destined</i> for captivity, to captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he must be killed. Here is the perseverance and the faith of the saints.

<br><font size="-1">12</font> He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. And he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.
<br><font size="-1">13</font> He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the presence of men.
<br><font size="-1">14</font> And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to perform in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who *had the wound of the sword and has come to life.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast would even speak and cause as many as do not worship the image of the beast to be killed.
<br><font size="-1">16</font> And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead,
<br><font size="-1">17</font> and <i>he provides</i> that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, <i>either</i> the name of the beast or the number of his name.
<br><font size="-1">18</font> Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.

<br><font size="-1">3</font> And they *sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they have kept themselves chaste. These <i>are</i> the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb.

<br><font size="-1">11</font> "And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name."
<br><font size="-1">12</font> Here is the perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.

<br><font size="-1">19</font> So the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered <i>the clusters from</i> the vine of the earth, and threw them into the great wine press of the wrath of God.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood came out from the wine press, up to the horses'' bridles, for a distance of two hundred miles.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="6640s"></a>A Scene of Heaven</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels who had seven plagues, <i>which are</i> the last, because in them the wrath of God is finished.
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of God.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> And they *sang the song of Moses, the bond-servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, <br>
<br><b><font size="-1"></font></b> "Great and marvelous are Your works, <br>O Lord God, the Almighty; <br>Righteous and true are Your ways, <br>King of the nations!

<br><font size="-1">7</font> Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.
<br><font size="-1">8</font> And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one was able to enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.

<font size="-1">1</font> Then I heard a loud voice from the temple, saying to the seven angels, "Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God."
<br><font size="-1"><b>2</b></font> So the first <i>angel</i> went and poured out his bowl on the earth; and it became a loathsome and malignant sore on the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image.
<br><font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> The second <i>angel</i> poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like <i>that</i> of a dead man; and every living thing in the sea died.
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> Then the third <i>angel</i> poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters; and they became blood.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> And I heard the angel of the waters saying, "Righteous are You, who are and who were, O Holy One, because You judged these things;
<br><font size="-1">6</font> for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink. They deserve it."
<br><font size="-1">7</font> And I heard the altar saying, "Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments."
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> The fourth <i>angel</i> poured out his bowl upon the sun, and it was given to it to scorch men with fire.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> Men were scorched with fierce heat; and they blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory.
<br><font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> Then the fifth <i>angel</i> poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues because of pain,
<br><font size="-1">11</font> and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they did not repent of their deeds.
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> The sixth <i>angel</i> poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates; and its water was dried up, so that the way would be prepared for the kings from the east.
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="6642s"></a>Armageddon</i></b></font></p>

<br><font size="-1">14</font> for they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> ("Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his clothes, so that he will not walk about naked and men will not see his shame.")

<br><font size="-1">18</font> And there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as there had not been since man came to be upon the earth, so great an earthquake <i>was it, and</i> so mighty.
<br><font size="-1">19</font> The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of His fierce wrath.
<br><font size="-1">20</font> And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
<br><font size="-1">21</font> And huge hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, *came down from heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, because its plague *was extremely severe.

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="6644s"></a>The Doom of Babylon</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, "Come here, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> with whom the kings of the earth committed <i>acts of</i> immorality, and those who dwell on the earth were made drunk with the wine of her immorality."
<br><font size="-1">3</font> And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.
<br><font size="-1">4</font> The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a gold cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality,
<br><font size="-1">5</font> and on her forehead a name <i>was</i> written, a mystery, "BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."
<br><font size="-1">6</font> And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered greatly.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> And the angel said to me, "Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> "The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth, whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will wonder when they see the beast, that he was and is not and will come.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> "Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits,
<br><font size="-1">10</font> and they are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> "The beast which was and is not, is himself also an eighth and is <i>one</i> of the seven, and he goes to destruction.
<br><font size="-1">12</font> "The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour.

<br><font size="-1">17</font> "For God has put it in their hearts to execute His purpose by having a common purpose, and by giving their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God will be fulfilled.

<br><font size="-1">2</font> And he cried out with a mighty voice, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a dwelling place of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> "For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the passion of her immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed <i>acts of</i> immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the wealth of her sensuality."
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> I heard another voice from heaven, saying, "Come out of her, my people, so that you will not participate in her sins and receive of her plagues;
<br><font size="-1">5</font> for her sins have piled up as high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.
<br><font size="-1">6</font> "Pay her back even as she has paid, and give back <i>to her</i> double according to her deeds; in the cup which she has mixed, mix twice as much for her.
<br><font size="-1">7</font> "To the degree that she glorified herself and lived sensuously, to the same degree give her torment and mourning; for she says in her heart, ''I <font size="-1">SIT</font> <i>as</i> <font size="-1">A QUEEN AND</font> I <font size="-1">AM NOT A WIDOW</font>, and will never see mourning.''
<br><font size="-1">8</font> "For this reason in one day her plagues will come, pestilence and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire; for the Lord God who judges her is strong.

<br><font size="-1"><b>11</b></font> "And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargoes any more&#151;

<br><font size="-1">14</font> "The fruit you long for has gone from you, and all things that were luxurious and splendid have passed away from you and <i>men</i> will no longer find them.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> "The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,

<br><font size="-1">20</font> "Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her."
<br><font size="-1"><b>21</b></font> Then a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "So will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence, and will not be found any longer.

<br><font size="-1">14</font> And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white <i>and</i> clean, were following Him on white horses.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.

<br><font size="-1">3</font> and he threw him into the abyss, and shut <i>it</i> and sealed <i>it</i> over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.
<br><font size="-1"><b>4</b></font> Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them.

<br><font size="-1">16</font> The city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as the width; and he measured the city with the rod, fifteen hundred miles; its length and width and height are equal.
<br><font size="-1">17</font> And he measured its wall, seventy-two yards, <i>according to</i> human measurements, which are <i>also</i> angelic <i>measurements.</i>
<br><font size="-1">18</font> The material of the wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.

<br><font size="-1">21</font> And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.
<br><font size="-1"><b>22</b></font> I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.

<br><font size="-1">25</font> In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its gates will never be closed;
<br><font size="-1">26</font> and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it;

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="6657s"></a>The River and the Tree of Life</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1">1</font> Then he showed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb,
<br><font size="-1">2</font> in the middle of its street. On either side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve <i>kinds of</i> fruit, yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
<br><font size="-1">3</font> There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him;
<br><font size="-1">4</font> they will see His face, and His name <i>will be</i> on their foreheads.
<br><font size="-1">5</font> And there will no longer be <i>any</i> night; and they will not have need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God will illumine them; and they will reign forever and ever.
<br><font size="-1"><b>6</b></font> And he said to me, "These words are faithful and true"; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His bond-servants the things which must soon take place.
<br><font size="-1"><b>7</b></font> <font color="red">"And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>8</b></font> I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed me these things.
<br><font size="-1">9</font> But he *said to me, "Do not do that. I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brethren the prophets and of those who heed the words of this book. Worship God."
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a name="6658s"></a>The Final Message</i></b></font></p>

<font size="-1"><b>10</b></font> And he *said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.
<br><font size="-1">11</font> "Let the one who does wrong, still do wrong; and the one who is filthy, still be filthy; and let the one who is righteous, still practice righteousness; and the one who is holy, still keep himself holy."
<br><font size="-1"><b>12</b></font> <font color="red">"Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward <i>is</i> with Me, to render to every man according to what he has done.</font>
<br><font size="-1">13</font> <font color="red">"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>14</b></font> Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city.
<br><font size="-1">15</font> Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying.
<br><font size="-1"><b>16</b></font> <font color="red">"I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star."</font>
<br><font size="-1"><b>17</b></font> The Spirit and the bride say, "Come." And let the one who hears say, "Come." And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who wishes take the water of life without cost.
<br><font size="-1"><b>18</b></font> I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book;
<br><font size="-1">19</font> and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book.
<br><font size="-1"><b>20</b></font> He who testifies to these things says, <font color="red">"Yes, I am coming quickly."</font> Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.
<br><font size="-1"><b>21</b></font> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen. <br><br>
